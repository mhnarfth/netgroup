abstract: Logical key hierarchy (LKH) is a promising solution to handle group key
  distribution in secure group communication. Several recent studies have investigated
  different approaches to reduce the re-keying cost of LKH. For certain group communication
  applications, such as the subscription pay TV; a member's departure time is available
  when the member joins the group. The proposed scheme aims to improve the re-keying
  cost for such applications. It uses a combination of an AVL tree and a binary search
  tree called the leaving tree as the topology of its key tree. Both the AVL tree
  and the leaving tree are searchable by members' departure times. Our analysis shows
  that the average costs in terms of the number of key updates for the member join
  and leave are O(logn) and O(loglog n), respectively. Our simulation results show
  that the proposed scheme achieves better performance than other balanced tree based
  solutions.
