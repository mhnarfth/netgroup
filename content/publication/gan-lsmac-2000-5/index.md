abstract: "Server scalability is more important than ever in today's client/server
  dominated network environments. Recently, researchers have begun to consider cluster-based
  computers using commodity hardware as an alternative to expensive specialized hardware
  for building scalable Web servers. In this paper, we present performance results
  comparing two cluster-based Web servers based on different server architectures:
  OSI layer two dispatching (LSMAC) and OSI layer three dispatching (LSNAT). Both
  cluster-based server systems were implemented as application-space programs running
  on commodity hardware in contrast to other, similar, solutions which require specialized
  hardware/software. We point out the advantages and disadvantages of both systems.
  We also identify when servers should be clustered and when clustering will not improve
  performance."
