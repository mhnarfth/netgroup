abstract: Dynamic conferencing refers to a scenario wherein any subset of users in
  a universe of users form a conference for sharing confidential information among
  themselves. The key distribution (KD) problem in dynamic conferencing is to compute
  a shared secret key for such a dynamically formed conference. In literature, the
  KD schemes for dynamic conferencing either are computationally unscalable or require
  communication among users, which is undesirable. The extended symmetric polynomial
  based dynamic conferencing scheme (ESPDCS) is one such KD scheme which has a high
  computational complexity that is universe size dependent. In this paper we present
  an enhancement to the ESPDCS scheme to develop a KD scheme called universe-independent
  SPDCS (UI-SPDCS) such that its complexity is independent of the universe size. However,
  the UI-SPDCS scheme does not scale with the conference size. We propose a relatively
  scalable KD scheme termed as DH-SPDCS that uses the UI-SPDCS scheme and the tree-based
  group Diffie-Hellman (TGDH) key exchange protocol. The proposed DH-SPDCS scheme
  provides a configurable trade-off between computation and communication complexity
  of the scheme.
