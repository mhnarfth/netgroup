abstract: The requirements for large-scale computing, storage, and network capabilities
  by the business and scientific communities have led to the development of the grid/cloud
  network. Grid network users can access a shared set of resources for scientific
  computing tasks. Cloud tenants are offered IT infrastructure through infrastructure
  as a service. An efficient resource scheduling mechanism across the network, as
  a result, will improve the resource utilization and also reduce the capital cost
  of scheduling in the cloud significantly. In this paper, we focus on the joint resource
  (processor, storage, and network) allocation in the grid/cloud environment. The
  multilayer optical network architecture is introduced to guarantee the reservation
  of the network bandwidth resource. We investigate the bandwidth guaranteed joint
  resource scheduling from the cloud provider&#x2019;s point of view, which is completing
  the resource scheduling with minimal capital expenditure. The mixed integer linear
  programming (MILP) formulations and heuristics (best-fit and tabu search) are developed
  to solve our problems. The results show that both MILP and heuristics work well
  to solve the problem, and the heuristics are much more time-efficient. In addition,
  the tabu search method achieves the optimal resource allocation and also reaches
  a lower blocking rate compared to the best-fit method.
