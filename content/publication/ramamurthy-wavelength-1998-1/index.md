abstract: Wavelength conversion has been proposed for use in wavelength-division multiplexed
  networks to improve efficiency. This study highlights systems challenges and performance
  issues which need to be addressed in order to incorporate wavelength conversion
  effectively. A review/survey of the enabling technologies, design methods, and analytical
  models used in wavelength-convertible networks is provided.
