abstract: A transparent (wide-area) wavelength-routed optical network may be constructed
  by using wavelength cross-connect switches connected together by fiber to form an
  arbitrary mesh structure. The network is accessed through electronic stations that
  are attached to some of these cross-connects. These wavelength cross-connect switches
  have the property that they may configure themselves into unspecified states. Each
  input port of a switch is always connected to some output port of the switch whether
  or not such a connection Is required for the purpose of information transfer. Due
  to the presence of these unspecified states, there exists the possibility of setting
  up unintended all-optical cycles in the network (viz., a loop with no terminating
  electronics in it). If such a cycle contains amplifiers [e.g., erbium-doped fiber
  amplifiers (EDFA's)], there exists the possibility that the net loop gain is greater
  than the net loop loss. The amplified spontaneous emission (ASE) noise from amplifiers
  can build up in such a feedback loop to saturate the amplifiers and result in oscillations
  of the ASE noise in the loop. Such all-optical cycles as defined above (and hereafter
  referred to as \"white\" cycles) must be eliminated from an optical network in order
  for the network to perform any useful operation. Furthermore, for the realistic
  case in which the wavelength cross-connects result in signal crosstalk, there is
  a possibility of having closed cycles with oscillating crosstalk signals. We examine
  algorithms that set up new transparent optical connections upon request while avoiding
  the creation of such cycles in the network. These algorithms attempt to find a route
  for a connection and then (in a post-processing fashion) configure switches such
  that white cycles that might get created would automatically get eliminated. In
  addition, our call-set-up algorithms can avoid the possibility of crosstalk cycles.
