 abstract = {Research and development on optical wavelength division multiplexed (WDM) networkshave matured considerably over the past few years, and a number of experimental prototypes have been deployed and are being tested in the U.S., Europe, and Japan. It is anticipated that the next generation of the Internet will employ WDM-based optical backbones.},
