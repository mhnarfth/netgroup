  ABSTRACT Access control is a fundamental security issue in any com- puter or communication
  system where there are users and resources. Recently a novel approach for access
  control, called unified hierarchy (UH), was proposed. In this pa- per, we present
  algorithms for implementing unified hier- archy and combining two unified hierarchies
  into one. Fur- ther, we propose typical queries for unified hierarchy and show that
  most of these queries can be executed'
