Dr. Byrav Ramamurthy, a distinguished faculty member of the University of Nebraska-Lincoln, has been awarded a significant grant from the National Science Foundation to lead a groundbreaking research project in intelligent optical networks. 

This project, titled "Intelligent Optical Networks Using Virtualization and Software-Defined Control," aims to redefine the capabilities of Internet Service Providers (ISPs) by implementing innovative solutions in software-defined networking (SDN) and virtualization.

The primary objective of this research is to develop a unified architecture for Software-Defined Optical Networks (SDON) that facilitates seamless end-to-end provisioning of services across heterogeneous, multi-domain networks. By addressing the complex challenges faced by large ISPs, this project seeks to enable:

**Efficient End-to-End Provisioning:** Implementation of fast, cost-effective, and integrated services over diverse network domains.

**Dynamic Resource Allocation:** Utilization of virtual transport links (VTL) and bandwidth-on-demand (BoD) techniques to optimize resource management.

**Multi-Layer Network Optimization:** Exploration of Resource Delayed Release (RDR) strategies and inter-domain tunnels to accelerate data transfers across Optical Transport Network (OTN), Wavelength Division Multiplexing (WDM), and Elastic Optical Networking (EON) layers.

The project's innovative approach leverages SDN to overcome the challenges of modern ISP infrastructures, enhancing network automation and reducing costs. By integrating virtualization and software-defined control, Dr. Ramamurthy's research is poised to usher in a new era of intelligent, adaptable, and efficient optical networks.

This prestigious NSF award underscores the project's potential to contribute significantly to the field of networking technology and reflects the Foundation's commitment to advancing research with substantial intellectual merit and broader impacts.
