	abstract = {This paper discusses the application of a cost constrained risk informed design paradigm to developing a crewed Mars exploration program. Parameters that are studied in the planning and optimization of a space program typically include the cost, schedule, risk and performance. The measure of success of a given space program architecture depends on the ability to meet certain predefined criteria with respect to these interdependent parameters. Large programs tend to be beset with cost overruns and schedule delays arising from technical risks. A notional model of integrated mission risk, taking into account the transient trends of hardware maturation is discussed. The total time taken to accomplish the first complete mission- from the start of the campaign to the safe return of crew to the Earth is considered as a metric. This model is used to investigate how risks associated with hardware, stemming from as yet unresolved or unrealized technical issues or defects in the design, impact the schedule risk. The mission end date distribution generated by this model and the sensitivity of the solution to different levels of initial maturity for the key hardware elements is discussed. Observations regarding strategic risk mitigation are provided on the basis of this analysis.},

	abstract = {In a wavelength-routed optical network, a transmitted signal remains in the optical domain over the entire route (lightpath) assigned to it between its source and destination nodes. The optical signal may have to traverse a number of crossconnect switches (XCSs), fiber segments, and optical amplifiers, e.g., erbium-doped fiber amplifiers (EDFAs). Thus, while propagating through the network, the signal may degrade in quality as it encounters crosstalk at the XCSs and also picks up amplified spontaneous emission (ASE) noise at the EDFAs. Since these impairments continue to degrade the signal quality as it progresses towards its destination, the receiver bit error rate (BER) at the destination node might become unacceptably high. Previous work on the lightpath routing and wavelength assignment (RWA) problems assumed an ideal physical layer and ignored these transmission impairments. The mam contribution of our work is to incorporate the role the physical layer in setting up lightpaths by employing appropriate models of multi-wavelength optical devices (XCSs and EDFAs) such that the BER of a candidate lightpath can be computed to determine if this lightpath should be used for the call. Features from existing RWA algorithms are integrated with our on-line BER calculation mechanism. Our simulation studies indicate that employing BER-based call admission algorithms has a significant impact on the performance of realistic networks.},

Such high demands on capacity (bandwidth) could lead to a “bandwidth-crunch” at the core wide-area network resulting in degradation of service-quality. Fortunately, technological innovations have emerged which can provide some relief to the end-user struggling with the Internet’s well-known delay and bandwidth limitations. At the physical layer, a complete overhaul of existing networks is envisaged from electronic media (such as twisted-pair and cable) to optical fibers [1]. Optical fibers employing the promising technique of wavelength division multiplexing (WDM) can support around 1000 times the capacity of their electronic counterparts. WDM allows the simultaneous transmission of several channels on the same fiber each on a different wavelength (frequency) [2, 3, 4]. WDM is already being deployed in commercial point-to-point fiber links including undersea installations. WDM-based optical networks are currently being tested in the U.S. (e.g., MОNЕТ, NТONC projects) [5] and Europe (RACE, ACТS projects) [6].},

For example, a Web server can host Web pages for several different companies and individuals. Traditionally, Web service providers (WSPs) provide all customers with the same level of performance (best-effort service). Most service differentiation has been in the pricing structure (individual vs. business rates) or the connectivity type (dial-up access vs. leased line, etc.). This report presents DiffServer, a program that implements two simple, server-side, application-level mechanisms (server-centric and client-centric) to provide different levels of Web service. The results of the experiments show that there is not much overhead due to the addition of this additional layer of abstraction between the client and the Apache Web server under light load conditions. Also, the average waiting time for high priority requests decreases significantly after they are assigned priorities as compared to a FIFO approach.},

Our previous study proved the feasibility of translucent networks using the sparse regeneration technique. We addressed the placement of regenerators based on static schemes allowing only fixed number of regenerators at fixed locations. This paper furthers the study by proposing a suite of dynamical routing schemes. Dynamic allocation, advertisement and discovery of regeneration resources are proposed to support sharing transmitters and receivers between regeneration and access functions. This study follows the current trend in the optical networking industry by utilizing the extension of IP control protocols. Dynamic routing algorithms, aware of current regeneration resources and link states, are designed to smartly route the connection requests under quality constraints. A hierarchical network model, supported by the MPLS-based control plane, is also proposed to provide scalability. Experiments show that network performance is improved without placement of extra regenerators.},

	abstract = {Centralized and distributed methods are two connection management schemes in wavelength convertible optical networks. In the earlier work, the centralized scheme is said to have lower network blocking probability than the distributed one. Hence, much of the previous work in connection management has focused on the comparison of different algorithms in only distributed scheme or in only centralized scheme. However, we believe that the network blocking probability of these two connection management schemes depends, to a great extent, on the network traffic patterns and reservation times. Our simulation results reveal that the performance improvement (in terms of blocking probability) of the centralized method over the distributed method is inversely proportional to the ratio of average connection inter-arrival time to reservation time. After that the ratio increases beyond a threshold, those two connection management schemes yield almost the same blocking probability under the same network load. In this paper, we review the working procedure of distributed and centralized schemes, discuss the tradeoff between them, compare these two methods under different network traffic patterns via simulation and give our conclusion based on the simulation data.},

Moreover, the traffic pattern of the optical network changes from time to time. How to develop dynamic reconfiguration algorithms for traffic grooming is an important issue. In this paper, two cases (best fit and full fit) for handling reconfigurable SONET over WDM networks are proposed. For each approach, an integer linear programming model and heuristic algorithms (TS-1 and TS-2, based on the tabu search method) are given. The results demonstrate that the TS-1 algorithm can yield better solutions but has a greater running time than the greedy algorithm for the best fit case. For the full fit case, the tabu search heuristic yields competitive results compared with an earlier simulated annealing based method and it is more stable for the dynamic case.},

Wavelength Division Multiplexing (WDM) is a technique that can harness the huge bandwidth available in an optical fiber to satisfy the network demand. Due to the multiplicity of the connections on any single link, fault tolerance is of utmost importance in such WDM networks. Active research on providing fault tolerance in WDM networks in recent times underscores its significance. In this study, a dynamic partitioning protection routing technique for routing a Fault Tolerant Path Set (FTPS) in a network is proposed. Wavelength assignment schemes to this FTPS with backup multiplexing technique for networks with no wavelength conversion and full wavelength conversion are discussed. Performance is measured in terms of blocking probability and time to recover the failed connections.

Traffic grooming is needed to resolve this mismatch in an efficient way. We study the dynamic traffic grooming problem in WDM mesh networks using the fixed-alternate routing (FAR) approach. Based on the FAR approach, we propose the fixed-order grooming (FOG) algorithm to support on-line provisioning of multi-granularity subwavelength connections. As traffic grooming involves two-layered routing, it is significantly different from the routing and wavelength assignment (RWA) problem in wavelength-routed WDM networks. We introduce the route selection problem (also called grooming node selection problem) and propose three grooming policies to address this problem. The three grooming policies are load sharing (LS), sequential grooming (SG) and minimum gap (MG). To address the wavelength and transceiver constraints, we propose another three grooming policies including least physical hop first (LPH), least virtual hop first (LVH) and least stringent resource first (LSR). Simulations are conducted to evaluate the performance of the FOG grooming algorithm and the grooming policies.},

All arriving control packets are first buffered in the queues and then scheduled using the bandwidth reservation algorithm, in which real-time control packets are considered first before non-real-time control packets in reserving bandwidth. Simulation results show that our proposed protocol is averagely 52.72\% better than a First Come First Served (FCFS) protocol in guaranteeing QoS of real-time traffic when the offered load ratio of real-time to non-real-time is set at 1: 9.},

	abstract = {The next-generation SONET metro network is evolving into a service-rich infrastructure. At the edge of such a network, multi-service provisioning platforms (MSPPs) provide efficient data mapping enabled by generic framing procedure (GFP) and virtual concatenation (VC). The core of the network tends to be a meshed architecture equipped with multi-service switches (MSSs), In the context of these emerging technologies, we propose a load-balancing spare capacity reallocation approach to improve network utilization in the next-generation SONET metro networks. Using our approach, carriers can postpone network upgrades, resulting in increased revenue with reduced capital expenditures (CAPEX). For the first time, we consider the spare capacity reallocation problem from a capacity upgrade and network planning perspective. Our approach can operate in the context of shared-path protection (with backup multiplexing) because it reallocates spare capacity without disrupting working services. Unlike previous spare capacity reallocation approaches which aim at minimizing total spare capacity, our load-balancing approach minimizes the network load vector (NLV), which is a novel metric that reflects the network load distribution. Because NLV takes into consideration both uniform and non-uniform link capacity distribution, our approach can benefit both uniform and non-uniform networks. We develop a greedy load-balancing spare capacity reallocation (GLB-SCR) heuristic algorithm to implement this approach. Our experimental results show that GLB-SCR outperforms a previously proposed algorithm (SSR) in terms of established connection capacity and total network capacity in both uniform and non-uniform networks.},

This paper furthers those studies by proposing a dynamic resource allocation and dynamic routing scheme to operate translucent networks. This scheme is realized through dynamically sharing regeneration resources, including transmitters,receivers, and electronic interfaces, between regeneration and access functions under a multidomain hierarchical translucent network model. An intradomain routing algorithm, which takes into consideration optical-layer constraints as well as dynamic allocation of regeneration resources, is developed to address the problem of translucent dynamic routing in a single routing domain. Network performance in terms of blocking probability, resource utilization, and running times under different resource allocation and routing schemes is measured through simulation experiments.},

A grooming policy influences the resource utilization by determining the weight function of the auxiliary graph. We propose the least resource path first (LR) grooming policy, which is an improvement over the existing grooming policies in the literature, by integrating the wavelength and transceiver metrics together. Simulation results show that the LBAG model achieves a comparable blocking performance with the layered-AG approach while using a significantly less amount of running time. We also present the worst case time complexity analysis of the CIGA grooming algorithm and evaluate the performance of the LR grooming policy by simulation.},

	abstract = {Traffic grooming is an essential functionality of WDM optical networks to provision multi-granularity subwave-length connections. Depending on the number of lightpaths allowed in a connection route, traffic grooming can be classified as single-hop traffic grooming (SH-TG) and multi-hop traffic grooming (MH-TG). MH-TG is more general and resource-efficient than SH-TG, because it allows connections from different source-destination pairs to share the bandwidth of a lightpath. In this paper, we propose a MH-TG algorithm, namely the fixed-order multi-hop (FOMH) grooming algorithm, based on the fixed-alternate routing approach. We introduce the grooming node selection (GNS) problem in MH-TG and propose three grooming policies, namely exhaustive sequential (ES), limited-hop sequential (LHS) and load sharing (LS) policies, to address the GNS problem. Given that the analysis of MH-TG is a relatively unexplored area, we propose an analytical model to evaluate the blocking performance of MH-TG using FOMH and the LS grooming policy. To address the multi-layered routing and multi-rate connection characteristics of traffic grooming, we introduce a novel multi-level decomposition approach in our analytical model which decomposes traffic at four different levels, namely alternate path, connection route, lightpath and link levels. The Erlang fixed-point approximation method is used to solve the analytical model. Numerical results show that analytical results matches well with simulation results. We also evaluate the effect of the grooming policies, the number of virtual hops (lightpaths) within a connection route and the number of alternate paths on the performance of the grooming algorithm.},

The proposed scheme aims to improve the re-keying cost for such applications. It uses a combination of an AVL tree and a binary search tree called the leaving tree as the topology of its key tree. Both the AVL tree and the leaving tree are searchable by members' departure times. Our analysis shows that the average costs in terms of the number of key updates for the member join and leave are O(logn) and O(loglog n), respectively.

	abstract = {Waveband switching (WBS) is a promising technique to reduce the switching and transmission costs in the optical domain of a wavelength-division multiplexing (WDM) network. This paper considers the problem of provisioning dynamic traffic using WBS in a WDM mesh network. The network of interest is a homogeneous WBS network, where each node has the functionality of WBS. The problem is called the dynamic WBS problem, which involves searching waveband-routes or wavelength-routes for the dynamically arriving traffic requests. The objective is to minimize the total switching and transmission costs in the optical domain. To solve the dynamic WBS problem, an auxiliary graph model capturing the network state is proposed. Based on the auxiliary graph, two heuristic on-line WBS algorithms with different waveband grouping policies are proposed, namely the wavelength-first WBS algorithm based on the auxiliary graph (WFAUG) and the waveband-first WBS algorithm based on the auxiliary graph (BFAUG). Simulation results indicate that WBS is an attractive technique which reduces the overall switching and transmission costs by up to 30\% in the network. The results also show that the WFAUG algorithm outperforms the BFAUG algorithm in terms of port savings and cost savings.},

A lot of research has been carried out in the areas of authentication and key management for such networks. However, due to lack of existing standards for such networks, most of the proposed schemes are based on different assumptions and are applicable only in specific environments. Recently Balachandran et al. proposed CRTDH [1], a novel key agreement scheme for group communications in wireless ad hoc networks. The protocol has many desirable properties such as efficient computation of group key and support for high dynamics. However, the protocol does not discuss mutual authentication among the nodes and hence, suffers from two kinds of attacks: man-in-the-middle attack and Least Common Multiple (LCM) attack. This paper identifies the problems with the current CRTDH scheme and discusses these attacks. AUTH-CRTDH, a modified key agreement protocol with authentication capability, is also presented. Results from extensive experiments that were run on the proposed protocol and some other key agreement protocols including CRTDH are also discussed. It can be observed from the experiments that the new scheme is comparable with the CRTDH scheme and better than many other non-authenticated schemes in terms of performance.},

In this study, we propose an approach to support dynamic lightpath scheduling in such networks. To minimize blocking probability in a network that accommodates dynamic scheduled lightpath demands (D- SLDs), resource allocation should be optimized in a dynamic manner. However, for the network users who desire deterministic services, resources must be reserved in advance and guaranteed for future use. These two objectives may be mutually incompatible. Therefore, we propose a two-phase dynamic lightpath scheduling approach to tackle this issue. The first phase is the deterministic lightpath scheduling phase. When a lightpath request arrives, the network control plane schedules a path with guaranteed resources so that the user can get a quick response with the deterministic lightpath schedule. The second phase is the lightpath re-optimization phase, in which the network control plane re-provisions some already scheduled lightpaths. Experimental results show that our proposed two-phase dynamic lightpath scheduling approach can greatly reduce WDM network blocking.},

The key distribution (KD) problem in dynamic conferencing is to compute a shared secret key for such a dynamically formed conference. In literature, the KD schemes for dynamic conferencing either are computationally unscalable or require communication among users, which is undesirable. The extended symmetric polynomial based dynamic conferencing scheme (ESPDCS) is one such KD scheme which has a high computational complexity that is universe size dependent. In this paper we present an enhancement to the ESPDCS scheme to develop a KD scheme called universe-independent SPDCS (UI-SPDCS) such that its complexity is independent of the universe size. However, the UI-SPDCS scheme does not scale with the conference size. We propose a relatively scalable KD scheme termed as DH-SPDCS that uses the UI-SPDCS scheme and the tree-based group Diffie-Hellman (TGDH) key exchange protocol. The proposed DH-SPDCS scheme provides a configurable trade-off between computation and communication complexity of the scheme.},

We study the performance of HeteroWBS networks in terms of call blocking probability and cost savings under dynamic traffic requests. We propose an autonomous clustering-based HeteroWBS (AS-HeteroWBS) architecture to clusters the network into multiple autonomous systems (ASs). An AS may contain some specific nodes that provide WBS functions for all the nodes in the AS. Based on the architecture, three HeteroWBS algorithms are proposed.

Waveband switching technique has been proven to reduce the switch sizes considerably in large networks. Aggregation of wavelengths into wavebands and dis-aggregation of wavebands back to wavelengths can be done at end-nodes or intermediate-nodes. Most of the research on waveband switching has considered source-to-end switching. In intermediate waveband switching, aggregation and/or dis-aggregation can be done at an intermediate node. In the context of intermediate waveband switching, the problem of grooming wavelengths such that the number of ports saved is maximized is non-trivial. Recent research which considered intermediate waveband switching focused on routing and wavelength assignment problem such that the port saving is maximized. In this work we focus on the problem of intermediate waveband switching considering static traffic and assuming that routing and wavelength assignment is known. We define two intermediate waveband grooming polices, intermediate-to-destination waveband switching (ITD-WBS) and both-end-to-intermediate waveband switching (BETI-WBS), depending on where along the path aggregation/disaggregation of wavebands is done. We present greedy algorithms to compute wavebands for the two intermediate waveband grooming polices and analyze their computational complexities.},

Two protection schemes are proposed, namely the Protecting-waveBand-At-waveBand-Level-only (PBABL) and the Mixed-Protection-At-waveBand-and-Wavelength-Level (MPABWL). The PBABL protects each working waveband-path by a backup waveband-path. While the MPABWL protects each working waveband-path by either a backup waveband-path or multiple backup lightpaths. The performances of the two protection schemes in terms of gained revenue and cost saving are studied and compared. Integer linear programming (ILP) formulations are presented to solve the problems for each protection scheme. Numerical results of the ILPs and the experimental results of previously proposed heuristics are presented, which show that both heuristics can obtain optimum solutions. According to the results, under heavy load traffic the MPABWL scheme provides solutions with higher revenues than the PBABL scheme does. Under light load traffic, where network resources are sufficient to accommodate all the traffics, the PBABL scheme leads to less switching and transmission costs than the MPABWL scheme does.},

	abstract = {The next-generation SONET metro network is evolving into a service-rich infrastructure. At the edge of such a network, multiservice provisioning platforms (MSPPs) provide efficient data mapping enabled by Generic Framing Procedure (GFP) and Virtual Concatenation (VC). The core of the network tends to be a meshed architecture equipped with Multi-service Switches (MSSs). In the context of these emerging technologies, we propose a load-balancing spare capacity reallocation approach to improve network utilization in the next-generation SONET metro networks. Using our approach, carriers can postpone network upgrades, resulting in increased revenue with reduced capital expenditures (CAPEX). For the first time, we consider the spare capacity reallocation problem from a capacity upgrade and network planning perspective. Our approach can operate in the context of shared-path protection (with backup multiplexing) because it reallocates spare capacity without disrupting working services. Unlike previous spare capacity reallocation approaches which aim at minimizing total spare capacity, our load-balancing approach minimizes the network load vector (NLV), which is a novel metric that reflects the network load distribution. Because NLV takes into consideration both uniform and non-uniform link capacity distribution, our approach can benefit both uniform and non-uniform networks. We develop a greedy load-balancing spare capacity reallocation (GLB-SCR) heuristic algorithm to implement this approach. Our experimental results show that GLB-SCR outperforms a previously proposed algorithm (SSR) in terms of established connection capacity and total network capacity in both uniform and non-uniform networks.},

This paper investigates a key management protocol in wireless sensor networks which include multiple base stations. We consider the situations in which both the base stations and the sensor nodes can be compromised. The proposed key management protocol, mKeying, includes two schemes, a key distribution scheme, mKeyDist, supporting multiple base stations in the network, and a key revocation scheme, mKeyRev, used to efficiently remove the compromised nodes from the network.

This paper considers the peer selection problem in multi-view P2PMMS. This problem has been well studied in the traditional single-view P2PMMS; however, it becomes more complicated in multi-view P2PMMS, mainly due to the fact that a peer watching multiple channels joins multiple corresponding overlays. In this paper, we propose a novel peer selection algorithm, called Channel-Aware Peer Selection (CAPS), where a peer selects its neighboring peers based on the channel subscription of the system, in order to efficiently utilize the bandwidth of all peers in the system, especially those peers watching multiple channels. The results of a large-scale simulation with 10,000 peers and 4 channels shows that CAPS can significantly improve the system performance over the straightforward Random Peer Selection (RPS), which is widely used in single-view P2PMMS networks.},

	abstract = {Key management is a core mechanism to ensure the security of applications and network services in wireless sensor networks. It includes two aspects: key distribution and key revocation. Many key management protocols have been specifically designed for wireless sensor networks. However, most of the key management protocols focus on the establishment of the required keys or the removal of the compromised keys. The design of these key management protocols does not consider the support of higher level security applications. When the applications are integrated later in sensor networks, new mechanisms must be designed. In this paper, we propose a security framework, uKeying, for wireless sensor networks. This framework can be easily extended to support many security applications. It includes three components: a security mechanism to provide secrecy for communications in sensor networks, an efficient session key distribution scheme, and a centralized key revocation scheme. The proposed framework does not depend on a specific key distribution scheme and can be used to support many security applications, such as secure group communications. Our analysis shows that the framework is secure, efficient, and extensible. The simulation and results also reveal for the first time that a centralized key revocation scheme can also attain a high efficiency.},

In this paper, we propose a novel real-time communication scheme (RCS) to provide service-differentiated soft real-time guarantees for end-to-end communication in WSNs. We use hop-based geographic grouping to enable location awareness for sensor nodes with extremely low control overhead.We use dynamic forwarding with load-balanced receiver contention to provide a light-weight, yet efficient, routing technique, which can be easily adapted for duty cycle design. We use polling contention period based real-time MAC support to improve the service-differentiation granularity with better bandwidth utilization. The performance evaluation shows that our scheme can achieve low end-to-end latency, high on-time delivery ratio, fine services-differentiation granularity with load-balance for real-time traffic in unsynchronized low-cost WSNs.},

An important problem in P2P streaming systems is how to reduce their consumed bandwidth, which is a major concern of Internet service providers. Our work is motivated by the fact that a user may dynamically change the size of a window displaying a video stream according to his/her personal choice, a scenario we refer to as dynamic window resizing. In this paper, we propose a scheme called the partial forwarding scheme (PFS) based on layered coding, in which users with small windows help in forwarding a part of the enhancement layer. PFS significantly reduces the total consumed bandwidth while still maintaining the desired streaming quality. Our extensive simulation results show that PFS can reduce the total consumed bandwidth by up to 40\% while still maintaining satisfactory streaming quality.},

Trust establishment, key management, authentication, and authorization are important areas that need to be thoroughly researched before security in MANETs becomes a reality. This work studies the problem of secure group communications (SGCs) and key management over MANETs. It identifies the key features of any SGC scheme over such networks. AUTH-CRTDH, an efficient key agreement scheme with authentication capability for SGC over MANETs, is proposed. Compared to the existing schemes, the proposed scheme has many desirable features such as contributory and efficient computation of group key, uniform work load for all members, few rounds of rekeying, efficient support for user dynamics, key agreement without member serialization and defense against the Man-in-the-Middle attack, and the Least Common Multiple (LCM) attack. These properties make the proposed scheme well suited for MANETs. The implementation results show that the proposed scheme is computationally efficient and scales well to a large number of mobile users. Copyright © 2007 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.},

By observing that different users may watch a channel with different window sizes, we propose a cooperative scheme called partial participation scheme (PPS) in which different peers request a video stream at different rates based on their window sizes, and a subset of peers viewing the video stream using a small window work as helpers to forward extra data to help other peers using a large window. By reducing streaming rate received by small-window peers, the total amount of consumed bandwidth decreases without sacrificing users' satisfaction. PPS includes peer cooperative bandwidth allocation algorithms and neighbor maintenance mechanisms to achieve short resizing delay when a peer changes its window between different sizes. We evaluate the performance of PPS via a comprehensive set of metrics generated from extensive simulations. Our simulation results show that PPS greatly reduces the bandwidth consumption, achieves short resizing delay, and maintains high and stable streaming quality.},

Previous work on multi-view P2P streaming solves the fundamental inter-channel bandwidth competition problem at the individual peer level, and thus can be used with very limited types of streaming protocols. In this paper, we propose a new protocol for multi-view P2P streaming, called divide-and-conquer (DAC), which efficiently solves the inter-channel bandwidth competition problem using a divide-and conquer strategy at the channel level, and thus is flexible to work with various streaming protocols. This makes DAC more suitable for upgrading current single-view P2P live streaming systems to multi-view P2P live streaming systems. Our extensive packetlevel simulations show that DAC is efficient in allocating the overall system bandwidth among competing channels, is flexible in working with various streaming protocols, and is scalable in supporting a large number of users and channels.},

	abstract = {The success of commercial Peer-to-Peer (P2P) video streaming systems has triggered interest in exploiting end users' bandwidth to reduce the operating costs of IPTV and Content Distribution Networks (CDN) and to improve the user-perceived service quality. Traditionally, users watching different channels are organized into separate overlays, where there is no cooperation among different channels. However, based on measurement studies, cross-channel cooperation is found to be desirable due to the bandwidth imbalance among different channels. In this paper, we focus on studying the characteristics of existing and potential designs to help system designers choose proper cross-channel cooperation strategies considering efficiency and implementation complexity. Specifically, we propose simple models based on network flow graphs for three general designs, namely Naive Bandwidth allocation Approach (NBA), Passive Channel-aware bandwidth allocation Approach (PCA) and Active Channel-aware bandwidth allocation Approach (ACA) respectively, which capture the key characteristics of different designs. We develop closed-form results for two-channel systems. Then, we use extensive numerical simulations to compare the three designs for various peer population distributions, upload bandwidth distributions and channel structures. Our analytical and simulation results show that: 1) Though the NBA design can be implemented with low complexity, it cannot efficiently use user's bandwidth in general cases; 2) the PCA design can achieve the same bandwidth utilization efficiency as the ACA design in general cases; and 3) the ACA design should be used for special applications and systems in which a user is restricted to watch only one channel at a time.},

However, the interdependencies between end-to-end communication cost and the anycasting design parameters have not been systematically studied. In this paper, a statistical end-to-end cost model is presented to capture the end-to-end latency and energy consumption of anycasting operation under a realistic wireless channel model. By exploring the relationship between the end-to-end cost efficiency and the forwarding decision dependent anycasting design parameters, two anycasting forwarding metrics are proposed for fully distributed forwarding decision. By exploring the relationship among the preamble length, the size of the forwarding set and the achievable end-to-end cost efficiency, a series of preamble length control guidelines are proposed for low and extremely low duty-cycled WSNs. According to our analytical results and simulation validation, the proposed forwarding metrics help reduce the end-to-end latency and energy consumption by about 55\% for anycasting with moderate preamble length, compared with the existing heuristic forwarding metrics. The proposed preamble length control guidelines help reduce, by more than half, the end-to-end energy and latency costs in low and extremely-low duty-cycled WSNs.},

Then, we present an efficient scheme, KeyRev, for removing compromised sensor nodes from a wireless sensor network (WSN). Unlike most proposed key revocation schemes focusing on removing the compromised keys on the sensor nodes, the KeyRev scheme uses key update techniques to obsolesce the keys owned by the compromised sensor nodes and thus remove the nodes from the network. We analyze the security of the KeyRev scheme and compare its performance against another centralized key revocation scheme and a distributed key revocation scheme. Our analyses show that the KeyRev scheme is secure in spite of not removing the pre-distributed key materials at compromised sensor nodes. Simulation results also indicate that the KeyRev scheme is scalable and performs very well compared with other key revocation schemes in WSNs. Copyright © 2008 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.},

	abstract = {Many scientific and Grid applications require high-speed circuits of guaranteed bandwidth for scheduled transfers. Offline optimization of dynamic scheduled bandwidth demands is an efficient way of finding the near-optimal solution to the bandwidth scheduling problem. In this paper, we propose a continuous and parallel optimization method to address the dynamic and deterministic bandwidth scheduling problem in next generation wavelength-division multiplexing (WDM) networks. In this method a greedy algorithm and genetic algorithm are run in parallel in separate threads and both of them take the Dynamic Scheduled Bandwidth Demand (D-SBD) as their input. The user gets his response only from the greedy algorithm and hence he will get a deterministic answer in a short amount of time. The genetic algorithm takes as one of its inputs the output of the greedy algorithm and does the optimization of the D-SBDs with minimizing blocking probability as its fitness function. The greedy algorithm copies the optimized reservation database of the genetic algorithm at regular intervals. The user submitting a D-SBD request is unaware of the optimization done by the genetic algorithm. This method is evaluated using both trace-driven simulation of real network traffic from the DOE ESnet network and stochastic traffic in ESnet network topology and a 24 node network topology. We also compare our approach with an earlier proposed method called re-optimization at blocking. Adding the genetic algorithm improves the performance of the network (in terms of blocking probability) compared to using only the greedy approach or the re-optimization at blocking method.},

	abstract = {Peer-to-Peer (P2P) technology has become an attractive approach for enabling large-scale video streaming applications, but the factor of users’ subjective preferences is not paid enough attention in such networks. As users have various demand on video qualities, we can provide them with video streams at different resolutions without impairing their satisfaction. The adaptive streaming rate technique is a promising method. However, in providing adaptive streaming rate services, P2P live streaming design faces the following challenge: how to provide all users with uninterrupted video with their desired qualities in case that their demand dynamically changes? To shed more light on this problem, we first derive a model and formulate the problem as a resource demand vs supply problem. Then we present a framework to address the challenge via efficient bandwidth allocation and group cooperation. Through comprehensive simulations, we evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed framework, and conclude that it effectively helps existing solutions, such as Partial Participation Scheme (PPS), achieve better performance.},

	abstract = {To accommodate the increasing demands for bandwidth, Internet Service Providers (ISPs) have deployed higher-speed links and reconfigurable optical add drop multiplexers (ROADMs) in their backbone networks. To address the reliability challenges due to failures and planned outages, ISPs typically use two backbone routers at each central office in a dual-home configuration. Thus at the IP layer, redundant backbone routers as well as redundant transport equipment to interconnect them are deployed to provide reliability through node and path diversity. However, adding such redundant resources increases the overall cost of the network. Hence, a fundamental redesign of the backbone network which avoids such redundant resources by leveraging the capabilities of an intelligent optical transport network is a highly desirable objective. It is clear that such a redesign must lower costs without compromising on the reliability achieved by today's backbone networks. Modeling the costs and reliability of the network at all layers is an important step in achieving this objective. In this paper, we undertake an in-depth investigation of the cost and reliability considerations involved in designing the next-generation backbone network. Our work includes a detailed analysis of the operation, cost and reliability of the network at the IP layer and the multiple layers below it. We discuss alternative backbone network designs which use only a single router at each central office but use the optical transport layer to carry traffic to routers at other offices in order to survive failures or outages of the single local router. We discuss trade-offs involved in using these designs.},

The Internet is growing at a tremendous rate today. New services, such as telephony and multimedia, are being added to the pure data-delivery framework of yesterday. Such high demands on capacity could lead to a "bandwidth-crunch" at the core wide-area network resulting in degra dation of service quality. Fortunately, technological innovations have emerged which can provide relief to the end-user to overcome the In ternet's well-known delay and bandwidth limitations. At the physical layer, a major overhaul of existing networks has been envisaged from electronic media (such as twisted-pair and cable) to optical fibers - in the wide area, in the metropolitan area, and even in the local area set tings. In order to exploit the immense bandwidth potential of the optical fiber, interesting multiplexing techniques have been developed over the years. Wavelength division multiplexing (WDM) is such a promising tech nique in which multiple channels are operated along a single fiber si multaneously, each on a different wavelength. These channels can be independently modulated to accommodate dissimilar bit rates and data formats, if so desired. Thus, WDM carves up the huge bandwidth of an optical fiber into channels whose bandwidths (1-10 Gbps) are compati ble with peak electronic processing speed.},

DyCroNO comprises of the following components: i) an end-end (E2E) service provisioning and virtual path allocation algorithm, ii) a lightweight dynamic bandwidth adjustment strategy that leverages the extended duration statistics to ensure optimal network utilization and guarantee the quality-of-service (QoS), and iii) a load distribution mechanism to optimize the network load distribution at runtime. As another contribution, we design a real-time deep learning technique to predict the network load distribution. We implemented a Long Short-Term Memory-based (LSTM) method with a sliding window technique to dynamically (at runtime) predict network load distributions at various lead times. Simulations were performed over three topologies: NSFNet, Cost266 and Eurolarge using real-world traffic traces to model the traffic patterns. Results show that our approach lowers the mean link load and total resources significantly while improving the resource utilization when compared to existing approaches. Additionally, our deep learning-based method showed promising results in load distribution prediction with low root mean squared error (RMSE) and ∼90\% accuracy.},

	abstract = {In optical networks, simulation is a cost-efficient and powerful way for network planning and design. It helps researchers and network designers quickly obtain preliminary results on their network performance and easily adjust the design. Unfortunately, most optical simulators are not open-source and there is currently a lack of optical network simulation tools that leverage machine learning techniques for network simulation. Compared to Wavelength Division Multiplexing (WDM) networks, Elastic Optical Networks (EON) use finer channel spacing, a more flexible way of using spectrum resources, thus increasing the network spectrum efficiency. Network resource allocation is a popular research topic in optical networks. In EON, this problem is classified as Routing, Modulation and Spectrum Allocation (RMSA) problem, which aims to allocate sufficient network resources by selecting the optimal modulation format to satisfy a call request. SimEON is an open-source simulation tool exclusively for EON, capable of simulating different EON setup configurations, designing RMSA and regenerator placement/assignment algorithms. It could also be extended with proper modelings to simulate CapEx, OpEx and energy consumption for the network. Deep learning (DL) is a subset of Machine Learning, which employs neural networks, large volumes of data and various algorithms to train a model to solve complex problems. In this paper, we extended the capabilities of SimEON by integrating the DeepRMSA algorithm into the existing simulator. We compared the performance of conventional RMSA and DeepRMSA algorithms and provided a convenient way for users to compare different algorithms’ performance and integrate other machine learning algorithms.},

New network architectures had to be heterogeneous in order to fulfill the tighter requirements for latency, reliability, adaptability, etc, the seamless support for a variety of devices, protocols and applications led to the creation of the multi-layered network architectures that include Non Terrestrial Networks (NTN). Many research questions remain open and routing is one that is especially challenging. One manifestation of this heterogeneity is the diversity of spatio-temporal contacts established for communication between different network entities both inter- and intra-layer. In this paper, we expand the definition of heterogeneous wireless networks. We then propose a novel and rigorous mathematical model for contact classification that captures several aspects of heterogeneity. Finally, we provide real-world application examples and map them to our proposed classification.},

	abstract = {Named Data Networking (NDN) is a promising approach to provide fast in-network access to compact muon solenoid (CMS) datasets. It proposes a content-centric rather than a host-centric approach to data retrieval. Data packets with unique and immutable names are retrieved from a content store (CS) using Interest packets. The current NDN architecture relies on forwarding strategies that are only dependent upon on-path caching. Such a design does not take advantage of the cached content available on the adjacent off-path routers in the network, thus reducing data transfer efficiency. In this work, we propose a software-defined, storage-aware routing mechanism that leverages NDN router cache-states, software defined networking (SDN) and multipath forwarding strategies to improve the efficiency of very large data transfers. First, we propose a novel distributed multipath (D-MP) forwarding strategy and enhancements to the NDN Interest forwarding pipeline. In addition, we develop a centralized SDN-enabled control for the multipath forwarding strategy (S-MP), which leverages the global knowledge of NDN network states that distributes Interests efficiently. We perform extensive evaluations of our proposed methods on an at-scale wide area network (WAN) testbed spanning six geographically separated sites. Our proposed solutions easily outperform the existing NDN forwarding strategies. The D-MP strategy results in performance gains ranging between 10.4x to 12.5x over the default NDN implementation without in-network caching, and 12.2x to 18.4x with in-network caching enabled. For S-MP strategy, we demonstrate a performance improvement of 10.6x to 12.6x, and 12.9x to 18.5x, with in-network caching disabled and enabled, respectively. Further, we also present a comprehensive analysis of NDN cache management for large data transfers and propose a novel prefetching mechanism to improve data transfer performance. Due to the inherent capacity limitations of the NDN router caches, we use SDN to provide an intelligent and efficient solution for data distribution and routing across multiple NDN router caches. We demonstrate how software-defined control can be used to partition and distribute large CMS files based on NDN router cache-state knowledge. Further, SDN control will also configure the router forwarding strategy to retrieve CMS data from the network. Our proposed solution demonstrates that the CMS datasets can be retrieved 28\%–38\% faster from the NDN routers’ caches than existing NDN approaches. Lastly, we develop a prefetching mechanism to improve the transfer performance of files that are not available in the router’s cache.},

	abstract = {Resource allocation is a fundamental task in any PON and it is necessary to have an efficient scheme that reduces delay, maximizes bandwidth usage, and minimizes the resource wastage. A variety of dynamic bandwidth allocation (DBA) and dynamic wavelength and bandwidth allocation (DWBA) algorithms have been proposed which are based on different PONs (e.g., EPON, GPON, XG-PON, 10G EPON, etc.). But to our knowledge, no DWBA scheme for NG-PON2 system, with diverse customers and prioritized traffic, has been proposed yet. In this work, this problem is addressed and five different dynamic wavelength and bandwidth allocation (DWBA) schemes are proposed. First, mixed integer linear programming (MILP) models are developed to minimize the total delay of the high-priority data. Due to the MILP’s high computational complexity, heuristic algorithms are developed based on the MILP model insights. The five heuristic algorithms are: No Block-Split Heuristic (NBH), Equal Block-Split Heuristic (EBH), Priority-Based No Block-Split Heuristic (P-NBH), Priority-Based Equal Block-Split Heuristic (P-EBH), and Priority-Based Decider Block-Split Heuristic (P-DBH). Six priority classes of requests are introduced with the goal of minimizing the total delay for the high-priority data and to lessen the bandwidth wastage of the system. Finally, experiments for the performance evaluation of the five DWBA schemes are conducted. The results indicate that P-NBH, P-EBH, P-DBH schemes show a 47.63\% less delay and 30\% of less bandwidth wastage on average for the highest priority data transmission than the schemes without priority support (NBH and EBH). Among these five schemes, NBH method has the highest delay, whereas EBH and P-EBH waste more bandwidth than the other schemes. P-DBH is the most efficient among the five, because this scheme offers the lowest delay for high-priority data and the minimum bandwidth wastage for lower priority ones.},

Threat intelligence, when used with active monitoring of network traffic, can be critical to ensure reliable data communication between endpoints. Threat intelligence systems are well suited for analyzing anomalous behaviors in network traffic and can be employed to assist organizations in identifying and successfully responding to cyber-attacks. In this paper, we present a machine learning approach for clustering malicious uniform resource locators (URLs). We focus on a URL dataset gathered from a threat intelligence feeds framework. We implement a k-means clustering solution for grouping malicious URLs obtained from open source threat intelligence feeds. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our unsupervised learning technique to discover the hidden structures in the malicious URL dataset. Our URL keyword/text clustering solution provides valuable insights about the malicious URLs and aids network operators in policy decisions to mitigate cyber-attacks. The clusters obtained using our approach has a silhouette coefficient of 0.383 for a dataset containing over 11,000 malicious URLs. Lastly, we develop a probabilistic scoring model to calculate the percentage of malicious keywords present in a given URL. After analyzing over 72,000 malicious keywords, our model successfully identifies over 80\% of the URLs in a test dataset as malicious.},

An important challenge of delivering data to experimenters in the CMS workflow is the data volume. An experiment data file has an average size of 2 Gigabytes, with file sizes ranging between 100 Megabytes and 20 Gigabytes. Also, a complete dataset comprises of multiple files, with the dataset files ranging from 2 Terabytes and 100 Terabytes in size. Providing fast access to datasets is an important enabler for data-intensive science research. In our work, we demonstrate a Information-Centric Networking (ICN) approach to providing fast in-network access to CMS datasets. To that end, we must first address the problem of how to store large CMS files in network caches closer to the end-users. We propose a software-defined, storage-aware routing mechanism using named data networking (NDN) to achieve this goal.

	abstract = {Software-Defined Networking (SDN) is a dynamic, and manageable network architecture which is more cost-effective than existing network architectures. The idea behind this architecture is to centralize intelligence from the network hardware and funnel this intelligence to the management system (controller) [2]-[4]. Since the centralized SDN controller controls the entire network and manages policies and the flow of the traffic throughout the network, it can be considered as the single point of failure [1]. It is important to find some ways to identify different types of attacks on the SDN controller [8]. Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attack is one of the most dangerous attacks on SDN controller. In this work, we implement DDoS attack on the Ryu controller in a tree network topology using Mininet emulator. Also, we use a machine learning method, Vector Machines (SVM) to detect DDoS attack. We propose to install flows in switches, and we consider time attack pattern of the DDoS attack for detection. Simulation results show the effects of DDoS attacks on the Ryu controller is reduced by 36\% using our detection method.},

	abstract = {Resource allocation is an important component of many Cloud computing and datacenter management problems. For infrastructure as a service(IaaS) in the Cloud, the Cloud service provider allocates computing resources such as processor, memory, and storage. In addition to the computing infrastructures, the Cloud service provider in the future would also allocate bandwidth for some applications that require guaranteed bandwidth service to transmit a large amount of data. This type of guaranteed bandwidth service can be provided by provisioning a distinct connection from end-to-end, e.g., by provisioning wavelength(s) in a wavelength division multiplexed wavelength routed network. In this paper, we focus on interdatacenter network-aware optimal resource allocation in the Cloud from the customer's perspective. We develop a mixed integer linear programming (MILP) optimal mathematical model and heuristics (Best-Fit and Tabu search) to solve the budget optimized joint-resource allocation problem to minimize the rental cost for each customer. The experimental results show that our heuristics can achieve an approximate optimal solution to the MILP solution and can reduce the customer's rental cost by at least 30\%. The Best-Fit heuristic with shortest job execution time first and simplest job structure first (SSF) scheduling policies have a better performance in terms of the traffic blocking rate. The traffic blocking rates under both scheduling policies are 5-25\% less than other policies. The Tabu search-based heuristic with SSF job scheduling policy has a better performance in terms of the traffic blocking rate than other job scheduling policies. In addition, the Tabu search-based heuristic also reduces the blocking rate by 4-30\% compared with the Best-Fit heuristic under any job scheduling policy.},

We leverage emerging deep learning techniques for time-series modeling to develop an application-aware predictive analytics system for accurately forecasting GridFTP connection loads. Our solution integrates with a major U.S. CMS Tier-2 site; we use a real dataset representing 670 million GridFTP transfer connections measured over 18 months to drive our predictive analytics solution. First, we perform extensive analysis on this dataset and use the connection loads as an example to study the temporal dependencies between various user-roles and workflow memberships. We use the analysis to motivate the design of a gated recurrent unit (GRU) based deep recurrent neural network (RNN) for modeling long-term temporal dependencies and predicting connection loads. We develop a novel application-aware, predictive and intelligent load balancer, APRIL, that effectively integrates application metadata and load forecast information to maximize server utilization. We conduct extensive experiments to evaluate the performance of our deep RNN predictive analytics system and compare it with other approaches such as ARIMA and multi-layer perceptron (MLP) predictors. The results show that our forecasting model, depending on the user-role, performs between 5.88\%-92.6\% better than the alternatives. We also demonstrate the effectiveness of APRIL by comparing it with the load balancing capabilities of an existing production Linux Virtual Server (LVS) cluster. Our approach improves server utilization, on an average, between 0.5 to 11 times, when compared with its LVS counterpart.},

	abstract = {Data transfer in wide-area networks has been long studied in different contexts, from data sharing among data centers to online access to scientific data. Many software tools and platforms have been developed to facilitate easy, reliable, fast, and secure data transfer over wide area networks, such as GridFTP, FDT, bbcp, mdtmFTP, and XDD. However, few studies have shown the full capabilities of existing data transfer tools from the perspective of whether such tools have fully adopted state-of-the-art techniques through meticulous comparative evaluations. In this paper, we evaluate the performance of the four highperformance data transfer tools (GridFTP, FDT, mdtmFTP, and XDD) in various environments. Our evaluation suggests that each tool has strengths and weaknesses. FDT and GridFTP perform consistently in diverse environments. XDD and mdtmFTP show improved performance in limited environments and datasets during our evaluation. Unlike other studies on data transfer tools, we also evaluate the predictability of the tools’ performance, an important factor for scheduling different stages of science workflows. Performance predictability also helps in (auto)tuning the configurable parameters of the data transfer tool. We apply statistical learning techniques such as linear/polynomial regression, and k-nearest neighbors (kNN), to assess the performance predictability of each tool using its control parameters. Our results show that we can achieve good prediction performance for GridFTP and mdtmFTP using linear regression and kNN, respectively.},

Designing intelligent solutions that respond to traffic changes automatically will soon become a mandatory requirement in production networks. In this paper, we focus on designing an intelligent control plane for the MobilityFirst Future Internet architecture. This architecture proposes novel mechanisms to replace the Internet Protocol to better support content delivery and mobility, such as hop-by-hop transfer, storage-aware routing and separation of identifiers and network addresses. In earlier work, we have argued that these mechanisms can be bypassed for certain data flows. Indeed, when there is no mobility involved, it is more convenient to implement cut-through switching at lower layers to bypass the routing mechanisms. In this paper, we propose an inter-domain framework capable of cut-through switching in MobilityFirst. The proposed framework is capable of adding and removing flows from tunnels automatically. It is also capable of creating inter-domain tunnels based on flow behavior and inter-domain latency. Our implementation experiments show that the control plane delay can be reduced by 75\% when using inter-domain tunnels. Furthermore, the results also show how our framework needs fewer messages than current protocols such as label distribution protocol to setup intra-domain and inter-domain tunnels.},

Current research has focused on alternatives such as proof of reputation, proof of stake, and proof of elapsed-time to reduce the computational burden on the blockchain participants. Orthogonal to this effort, we focus on a specific set of applications that cannot commit much storage space and computational resources, but require only reasonable guarantees on the validity of transactions. To this end, we introduce blockchain design alternatives, collectively called ApproxBC, that can provide proof of transactions with provable confidence bounds. Consequently, ApproxBC can considerably reduce the computation and storage resources required, making them suitable for resource-constrained Internet of Things environments. We also showcase two approximation-tolerant applications that can leverage the quicker computation and smaller storage requirements.},

We propose an application-aware software-defined networking (SDN) approach for providing differentiated network services for high-energy physics projects such as Compact Muon Solenoid (CMS) and Laser Interferometer Gravitational-Wave Observatory (LIGO). We demonstrate a policy-driven approach for differentiating network traffic by exploiting application- and network-layer collaboration to achieve accurate accounting of resources used by each project. We implement two strategies, a 7-3 queuing system, and a 10-3 queuing system, and show that the 10-3 strategy provides an additional capacity improvement of 11.74\% over the 7-3 strategy.},

	abstract = {Reliance on cloud computing infrastructure has increased rapidly worldwide, and increasing amount of resources are provided to users by the cloud providers. User demand provisioning is an important issue for the cloud provider as the number of demands increases while the resources on the data center (DC) and the available bandwidth between DCs remain limited. The provisioning problem has serious implications in real-time scenarios, where the number of demands for the requested service is not known in advance. In this paper, we consider dynamic provisioning of the cloud resources including bandwidth scheduling for user demands where the requested DC resources (e.g. CPUs, storage and network ports) and bandwidth are not known in advance. We assume that the DCs are connected using IP/MPLS-over-WDM networks, which support grooming of the bandwidth from different demands where possible. Increasing the number of demands accepted while reducing the cost is important for providers. We propose and study the effects, of two greedy approaches to solve this problem, on the blocking probability and the total cost, which includes the operating expenditure (OpEx) and capital expenditure (CapEx).},

Access routers (ARs) are connected to these BRs in a dual-homed configuration. To provide reliability through node and path diversity, redundant backbone routers and redundant transport equipment to interconnect them are deployed. However, deploying such redundant resources increases the overall cost of the network. Hence, to avoid such redundant resources, a fundamental redesign of the backbone network leveraging the capabilities of an agile optical transport network is highly desired. In this paper, we propose a fundamental redesign of IP backbones. Our alternative design uses only a single router at each office. To survive failures or outages of a single local BR, we leverage the agile optical transport layer to carry traffic to remote BRs. Optimal mapping of local ARs to remote BRs is determined by solving an Integer Linear Program (ILP). We describe how our proposed design can be realized using current optical transport technology. We evaluate network designs for cost and performability, the latter being a metric combining performance and availability. We show significant reduction in cost for approximately the same level of reliability as current designs.},

Current protocols such as TCP/IP were not originally designed with mobility as a key consideration, and therefore underperform under challenging mobile and wireless conditions. MobilityFirst, a clean slate architecture proposal, embraces several key concepts centered around secure identifiers that inherently support mobility and trustworthiness as key requirements of the network architecture. This includes a hop-by-hop segmented data transport that allows late and dynamic rebinding of endpoint addresses to support mobility. While this provides critical gains in wireless segments, some overheads are incurred even in stable segments such as in the core. Bypassing layer 3 decisions in these cases, with lower layer cut through forwarding, can improve said gains. In this work, we introduce a general bypass capability within the MobilityFirst architecture that could provide both better performance and enable both individual and aggregate flow-level traffic control. Furthermore, we present a detailed OpenFlow-based design to bypass layer 3 routing in MobilityFirst, using layer 2 VLAN tagging. Finally, we present a prototype that shows that it is possible to use OpenFlow to create the bypass.},

With the additional time domain information, cost-efficient connections can be established. In this paper, we propose two capital expenditure (CapEx) optimized approaches: the multilayer (ML) approach and a transponder/regenerator reuse (TRR) approach. Integer linear programming (ILP) is used to formulate the routing, wavelength assignment, and regenerator/multiplexer placement problem in a complex multilayer optical network to provide lower bounds for the optimized CapEx value. Due to the time and space complexity of ILP when it deals with large networks and traffic demands, we also propose a greedy heuristic and a tabu-search (TS) heuristic to solve the same problem in a less time- and resource-consuming manner. Finally, we compare the results in terms of computing time and optimized CapEx value across the ILP, greedy heuristic, and TS heuristic methods with the ML approaches for the Internet2 topology and a six-node ring topology. The performance of all three methods with the TRR approach is also tested with the same input traffic, which is composed of a mix of 10, 40, and 100\&\#xA0;Gbps demands. The results show 30\%\&\#x2013;40\% less CapEx when comparing ML with TRR.

Grid/Clouds users are provided with IT infrastructure (servers, storage, networks, etc.) as services called Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS). In this case, an efficient resource scheduling mechanism for allocating the infrastructure resources across the network will improve the resource efficiency in the cloud significantly. In this paper, we investigate the budget optimization of joint resources (storage, processor and network) allocation for IaaS model in distributed Grid/Clouds from the consumer's perspective. We develop a Mixed Integer Linear Programming (MILP) formulation along with a new resource model and propose a Best-Fit heuristic algorithm with different job scheduling policies. Our goal is to minimize the expenditure for each user to obtain enough resources to execute their submitted jobs, while enabling the Grid/Cloud provider to accept as many job requests from the users as possible. Both MILP and heuristic are tested on a 10- node topology and the Google Datacenter topology. The results show that the heuristic method can achieve approximate optimal solutions to MILP; it can reduce the user expense by at least 30\%. In addition, Best-Fit algorithm with SSF (simple job structure first) job scheduling policy has the lowest blocking rate, which is 5\% 25\% less than other job scheduling policies.},

In this paper, we propose two capital expenditure (CapEx) optimized approaches: Multi-Layer (ML) approach and Transponder/Regenerator Reuse (TRR) approach. Integer Linear Programming (ILP) is used to formulate the routing, wavelength assignment and regenerator/multiplexer placement problem in a complex multi-layer optical network and provide lower bounds for the optimized CapEx value. Due to the time and space complexity of ILP, we also propose a greedy algorithm and a tabu-search algorithm to solve the same problem in a less time and resource consuming way. Finally, we compare the results in terms of computing time and optimized CapEx value across the ILP, greedy heuristic and tabu search heuristic methods with the ML approach for the Internet2 topology and a 6-node ring topology. The performance of all three methods with TRR approach is also tested with the same input traffic. The results show 30\% to 40\% less CapEx when comparing ML with TRR. Further, our tabu search heuristic can achieve near optimal results compared to ILP.},

	abstract = {A transparent (wide-area) wavelength-routed optical network may be constructed by using wavelength cross-connect switches connected together by fiber to form an arbitrary mesh structure. The network is accessed through electronic stations that are attached to some of these cross-connects. These wavelength cross-connect switches have the property that they may configure themselves into unspecified states. Each input port of a switch is always connected to some output port of the switch whether or not such a connection Is required for the purpose of information transfer. Due to the presence of these unspecified states, there exists the possibility of setting up unintended all-optical cycles in the network (viz., a loop with no terminating electronics in it). If such a cycle contains amplifiers [e.g., erbium-doped fiber amplifiers (EDFA's)], there exists the possibility that the net loop gain is greater than the net loop loss. The amplified spontaneous emission (ASE) noise from amplifiers can build up in such a feedback loop to saturate the amplifiers and result in oscillations of the ASE noise in the loop. Such all-optical cycles as defined above (and hereafter referred to as "white" cycles) must be eliminated from an optical network in order for the network to perform any useful operation. Furthermore, for the realistic case in which the wavelength cross-connects result in signal crosstalk, there is a possibility of having closed cycles with oscillating crosstalk signals. We examine algorithms that set up new transparent optical connections upon request while avoiding the creation of such cycles in the network. These algorithms attempt to find a route for a connection and then (in a post-processing fashion) configure switches such that white cycles that might get created would automatically get eliminated. In addition, our call-set-up algorithms can avoid the possibility of crosstalk cycles.},

	abstract = {Recently, there has been growing interest in developing optical fiber networks to support the increasing bandwidth demands of multimedia applications, such as video conferencing and World Wide Web browsing. One technique for accessing the huge bandwidth available in an optical fiber is wavelength-division multiplexing (WDM). Under WDM, the optical fiber bandwidth is divided into a number of nonoverlapping wavelength bands, each of which may be accessed at peak electronic rates by an end user. By utilizing WDM in optical networks, we can achieve link capacities on the order of 50 THz. The success of WDM networks depends heavily on the available optical device technology. This paper is intended as a tutorial on some of the optical device issues in WDM networks. It discusses the basic principles of optical transmission in fiber and reviews the current state of the art in optical device technology. It introduces some of the basic components in WDM networks, discusses various implementations of these components, and provides insights into their capabilities and limitations. Then, this paper demonstrates how various optical components can be incorporated into WDM optical networks for both local and wide-area applications. Finally, the paper provides a brief review of experimental WDM networks that have been implemented.},

Since there is an upper bound on transmitter power and a lower bound on receiver sensitivity, optical amplifiers are usually required to compensate for the power losses mentioned above.

	abstract = {In a wavelength-routed optical network, a transmitted signal remains in the optical domain over the entire route (lightpath) assigned to it between its source and destination nodes. The optical signal may have to traverse a number of crossconnect switches (XCS's), fiber segments, and optical amplifiers, e.g., erbium-doped fiber amplifiers (EDFA's). Thus, while propagating through the network, the signal may degrade in quality as it encounters crosstalk at the XCS's and also picks up amplified spontaneous emission (ASE) noise at the EDFA's. Since these impairments continue to degrade the signal quality as it progresses toward its destination, the received bit error rate (BER) at the destination node might become unacceptably high. Previous work on the lightpath routing and wavelength assignment (RWA) problem assumed an ideal physical layer and ignored these transmission impairments. The main contribution of our work is to incorporate the role of the physical layer in setting up lightpaths by employing appropriate models of multiwavelength optical devices (XCS's and EDFA's) such that the BER of a candidate lightpath can be computed, in advance, to determine if this lightpath should be used for the call. Features from existing RWA algorithms are integrated with our on-line BER calculation mechanism. Our simulation studies indicate that employing BER-based call-admission algorithms has a significant impact on the performance of realistic networks.},

The Internet is a variable-delay, variable- bandwidth network that provides no guarantee on quality of service (QoS) in its initial phase. New services are being added to the pure data delivery framework of yesterday. Such high demands on capacity could lead to a “bandwidth crunch” at the core wide-area network, resulting in degradation of service quality. Fortunately, technological innovations have emerged which can provide relief to the end user to overcome the Internet’s well-known delay and bandwidth limitations. At the physical layer, a major overhaul of existing networks has been envisaged from electronic media (e.g., twisted pair and cable) to optical fibers - in wide-area, metropolitan-area, and even local-area settings.

The problem we address is how to specify, enforce, and implement access control in distributed environments. This problem occurs in many applications such as management of distributed project resources, e-newspaper and pay TV subscription services. Starting from an access relation between users and resources, we derive a user hierarchy, a resource hierarchy, and a unified hierarchy. The unified hierarchy is then used to specify the access relation in a way that is compact and that allows efficient queries. It is also used in cryptographic schemes that enforce the access relation. We introduce three specific cryptography based hierarchical schemes, which can effectively enforce and implement access control and are designed for distributed environments because they do not need the presence of a central authority (except perhaps for setup).},

Due to the high cost of an optical amplifier, it is desirable to strategically place the amplifiers throughout the network in a way that guarantees that all the signals are adequately amplified while minimizing the total number amplifiers being used. Previous studies all consider a star-based network. This paper demonstrates an original approach for solving the problem in switch-based WDM optical network assuming the traffic matrix is always the permutation of the nodes. First we formulate the problem by choosing typical permutations which can maximize the traffic load on individual links; then a GA (genetic algorithm) is used to search for feasible amplifier placements.

Depending on the number of all-optical segments on a single lightpath, three approaches can be used to operate such a network. These approaches are: transparency, opacity and translucency. Because physical-layer impairments and wavelength continuity impose a fundamental limitation on the reach distance of WDM signals, the transparency approach is not practical in the near future. On the other hand, the opacity approach needs regeneration for every wavelength at every intermediate node, thus resulting in prohibitive costs. Therefore, the translucency approach is a viable solution for operation of optical networks currently and in the near future.},

Much of the work in this area has focused on proposing network architectures, solving the dynamic RWA problem, developing distributed protection/restoration schemes, standardizing network interfaces (eg UNI and NNI), and extending existing Internet routing/signaling protocols for WDM optical networks. We present an overview of the role of GMPLS in the next-generation optical core; concentrating on both the issues and the challenges in automatic lightpath provisioning and network restoration. First; we discuss the evolutionary trend and architectures of the next-generation optical network. Then, we present an overview of dynamic provisioning problems; followed by a discussion of various constraints and unique requirements for lightpath establishment in WDM optical networks.

Optical packet switching requires a good switch architecture, which eliminates the O/E/O conversion as much as possible.

Different applications have different requirements, which necessitate employing differentiated services. This paper presents the idea of a priority-based /spl lambda/-scheduler, where the packets are differentiated into different classes and services are provided accordingly. For example, class 0 can correspond to non-real-time applications like email and ftp, while class 1 can correspond to real-time audio and video communications. The architecture is based on that of the /spl lambda/-scheduler and hence it has the added advantage of reduced component cost by using WDM internally.},

Future home and enterprise Internet users need high-bandwidth end-to-end connections that have to be provisioned automatically and dynamically. We need to make optical-layer routing as scalable and flexible as IP routing in today's Internet to support high-end applications. We study the problem of interdomain dynamic wavelength routing based on a multidomain translucent optical network model, which allows end-to-end lightpaths to be set up not only across multiple routing domains but also through two network layers: the optical layer and the regeneration layer. In this model, a lightpath can traverse the domain boundary either through optical bypass (OOO) or through optical-electrical-optical regeneration (OEO). We propose an interdomain dynamic wavelength-routing scheme with modest computational complexity to address the problem from an algorithmic perspective. Our experimental results show that the proposed interdomain dynamic wavelength-routing scheme can (a) flexibly incorporate various cost metrics and local (or intradomain) routing schemes into a uniform interdomain routing framework, (b) effectively set up end-to-end lightpaths in a multidomain translucent network, and (c) efficiently use both optical- and regeneration-layer resources.},

	abstract = {Survivable routing of a connection involves computation of a pair of diverse routes such that at most one route fails when failures occur in the network topology. A subset of links in the network that share the risk of failure at the same time are said to belong to a shared risk link group (SRLG) [J. Strand et al., Feb 2001]. A network with shared risk link groups defined over its links is an SRLG network. A failure of an SRLG is equivalent to the failure of all the links in the SRLG. For a connection to be survivable in an SRLG network, its working and protection paths must be routed on SRLG diverse paths. SRLG diverse routing problem has been proved to be NP-complete in J.Q. Hu (2003). According to the quality of service requirement of a survivable connection request, dedicated protection or shared protection can be used to establish the connection request. With dedicated protection, the connection is established on both the SRLG diverse working and protection paths. The simplest heuristic for computing SRLG diverse path pair is the two-step approach, but it suffers from the trap topology problem. In the previous study by Pin-Han Ho, an iterative heuristic (ITSH) using the two-step approach was proposed to compute the least cost SRLG diverse path pair. Suurballe's algorithm computes a pair of least cost link-disjoint paths between a node pair. In this work, we present a modified Suurballe's heuristic for computing the SRLG diverse routes between a node pair. We then propose an iterative heuristic (IMSH) which uses the modified Suurballe's heuristic for computing the least cost SRLG diverse routes. We also present an 1/2-cost-improvement optimality check criterion for dedicated protection},

Groundwater resources in Nebraska are under increasing stress as there is a rapid growth in their usage. Water managers need more timely and accurate data to assess ground-water conditions to manage adverse situations such as drought and loss of pumpage in agriculture and domestic water supply. Currently groundwater researchers use stand-alone data logging equipment which is labor intensive and the method is not easily scalable if the number of logging locations increases. Commercially available real-time data monitoring solutions are either prohibitively costly or highly inflexible. In this paper, we present a design for a groundwater monitoring system based on a network of wirelessly-linked pressure sensors. The proposed solution will enable groundwater researchers and decision makers to have quick access to the groundwater data with less effort and cost. Though our design is initially meant for groundwater monitoring, it can be easily adapted to other fields of environmental monitoring.},

	abstract = {As wavelength-division multiplexing (WDM) evolves towards practical applications in optical transport networks, waveband switching (WBS) has been introduced to cut down the operational costs and to reduce the complexities and sizes of network components, eg, optical cross-connects (OXCs). This paper considers the routing, wavelength assignment and waveband assignment (RWWBA) problem in a WDM network supporting mixed waveband and wavelength switching. First, the techniques supporting waveband switching are studied, where a node architecture enabling mixed waveband and wavelength switching is proposed. Second, to solve the RWWBA problem with reduced switching costs and improved network throughput, the cost savings and call blocking probabilities along intermediate waveband-routes are analyzed. Our analysis reveals some important insights about the cost savings and call blocking probability in relation to the fiber capacity, the candidate path, and the traffic load. Third, based on our analysis, an online integrated intermediate WBS algorithm (IIWBS) is proposed. IIWBS determines the waveband switching route for a call along its candidate path according to the node connectivity, the link utilization, and the path length information. In addition, the IIWBS algorithm is adaptive to real network applications under dynamic traffic requests. Finally, our simulation results show that IIWBS outperforms a previous intermediate WBS algorithm and RWA algorithms in terms of network throughput and cost efficiency.},

	abstract = {Feature Issue on Waveband Switching, Routing, and GroomingAdopting waveband switching (WBS) in backbone wavelength division multiplexed (WDM) networks is promising since it can reduce the network operational cost and the call blocking probability. However, upgrading the existing optical switching architecture requires time and money. Thus heterogeneous waveband switching (HeteroWBS) architecture would be desirable in such a system, where some nodes can support WBS functions and some cannot. We study the performance of HeteroWBS networks in terms of call blocking probability and cost savings under dynamically arriving traffic requests. We first investigate the effects of optical component developments on waveband switching in WDM networks. Various connection managements are then listed and analyzed. Next, to assist in the designing of efficient WBS algorithms, an autonomous clustering-based HeteroWBS (AS-HeteroWBS) architecture is proposed. The AS-HeteroWBS architecture clusters the network into multiple autonomous systems (ASs). An AS may contain some specific nodes that provide WBS functions for all the nodes in the AS. Based on the architecture, three HeteroWBS algorithms are proposed, namely, the autonomous heterogeneous WBS algorithm (AS-WBS), the autonomous source-limited heterogeneous WBS algorithm (AS-S-WBS), and the shortest-path-based heterogeneous WBS algorithm (SH-WBS). Our simulation results show that the HeteroWBS algorithms can achieve optimal cost savings while maintaining the same network throughput compared with the algorithm without WBS.},

	abstract = {Wireless sensor networks (WSNs) use sensors to monitor phenomena such as temperature, humidity, groundwater levels and transmit this information to a base station using wireless channels. WSNs find applications in military, ecological, and health-related areas. A hybrid wireless sensor network includes two networks: an ad hoc wireless network and a wireless sensor network. The nodes in the ad hoc network act as base stations conducting surveillance on the WSN. In this dissertation, we focus on the key management issues in hybrid wireless sensor networks. The key management issues in hybrid wireless sensor networks can be divided into three categories according to which layer they affect: ad hoc network layer, wireless sensor network layer, and integrated cross layer. At the ad hoc network layer, we propose two elliptic curve discrete logarithm problem (ECDLP) based schemes for secure group communication (SGC). Unlike the vast majority of secure group communication protocols using the discrete logarithm problem (DLP) based Diffie-Hellman as the basic key agreement protocol, our solutions use the ECDLP-based Diffie-Hellman protocol. We also extend our research on secure group communication to the wireless sensor network layer. We formally define the grouping and secure group communication problems in WSNs. We further propose and evaluate four centralized group rekeying (CGK) schemes for SGC in WSNs. Our proposed key management protocol at the integrated cross layer, mKeying, includes two schemes, a key distribution scheme, KeyDist, supporting multiple base stations in the network, and a centralized key revocation scheme, KeyRev, for removing compromised sensor nodes from the sensor network. Through these protocols for key distribution, key revocation, and group communication, we present an integrated approach to provide security in hybrid wireless sensor networks.},

Key distribution has been extensively studied in the context of sensor networks. However, key revocation has received relatively little attention. Existing key revocation schemes can be divided into two categories: centralized key revocation scheme and distributed key revocation scheme. In this paper, we first summarize the current key revocation schemes for sensor networks. Then, we propose an efficient centralized key revocation scheme, KeyRev, for wireless sensor networks. Unlike most proposed key revocation schemes focusing on removing the compromised keys, we propose to use key updating techniques to obsolesce the keys owned by the compromised sensor nodes and thus remove the nodes from the network. Our analyses show that the KeyRev scheme is secure inspite of not removing the pre-distributed key materials at compromised sensor nodes. Simulation results also indicate that the KeyRev scheme is scalable and performs very well in wireless sensor networks.},

We propose two centralized group rekeying (CGK) schemes for secure group communication in sensor networks. The lifetime of a group is divided into three phases, i.e., group formation, group maintenance, and group dissolution.

By randomizing the rotation of cluster heads in each layer, the energy load is distributed evenly across sensors in the network. Our simulations show that LCH is effective in densely deployed sensor networks. On average, 70\% of live sensor nodes are involved directly in the clustering communication hierarchy. Moreover, the simulations also show that the energy load and dead nodes are distributed evenly over the network. As studies prove that the performance of LCH depends mainly on the distributed clustering protocol, the location of cluster heads and cluster size are two critical factors in the design of LCH.},

The objective of traffic grooming is to improve resource efficiency. However, resource contention between lightpaths and connections may result in inefficient resource usage or even the blocking of some connections. In this work, we employ a rerouting approach to alleviate resource inefficiency and improve the network throughput under a dynamic traffic model. We propose two rerouting schemes, rerouting at lightpath level (RRLP) and rerouting at connection level (RRCON) and a qualitative comparison is made between the two. We also propose two heuristic rerouting algorithms, namely the critical-wavelength-avoiding one-lightpath-limited (CWA-1L) rerouting algorithm and the critical-lightpath-avoiding one-connection-limited (CLA-1C) rerouting algorithm, which are based on the two rerouting schemes. Simulation results show that rerouting reduces the blocking probability of connections significantly.},

Parameters that are studied in the planning and optimization of a space program typically include the cost, schedule, risk and performance. The measure of success of a given space program architecture depends on the ability to meet certain predefined criteria with respect to these interdependent parameters. Large programs tend to be beset with cost overruns and schedule delays arising from technical risks. A notional model of integrated mission risk, taking into account the transient trends of hardware maturation is discussed. The total time taken to accomplish the first complete mission- from the start of the campaign to the safe return of crew to the Earth is considered as a metric. This model is used to investigate how risks associated with hardware, stemming from as yet unresolved or unrealized technical issues or defects in the design, impact the schedule risk. The mission end date distribution generated by this model and the sensitivity of the solution to different levels of initial maturity for the key hardware elements is discussed. Observations regarding strategic risk mitigation are provided on the basis of this analysis.},

A grid network that employs optical wavelength division multiplexing (WDM) technology and optical switches to interconnect computing resources with dynamically provisioned multigigabit rate bandwidth lightpath is called a lambda grid network. A computing task may be executed on any one of several computing nodes which possesses the necessary resources. In order to reflect the reality in job scheduling, allocation of network resources for data transfer should be taken into consideration. However, few scheduling methods consider the communication contention on lambda grids. In this paper, we investigate the joint scheduling problem while considering both optical network and computing resources in a lambda grid network. The objective of our work is to maximize the total number of jobs that can be scheduled in a lambda grid network. An adaptive routing algorithm is proposed and implemented for accomplishing the communication tasks for every job submitted in the network. Four heuristics (FIFO, ESTF, LJF, RS) are implemented for job scheduling of the computational tasks. Simulation results prove the feasibility and efficiency of the proposed solution.},

In particular, we investigate what is the optimal segment size that obtains the best tradeoff between the time taken for recovery and minimizing the bandwidth used by the backup segments.

Understanding the operational and failure behavior of crewed space launcher propulsion systems is critical to the characterization of integrated vehicle risk. The analysis of threats posed by the failure of these systems to the mission, vehicle and crew is informed by a study of off-nominal behavior. To better answer questions on the failure behavior of rocket engines, it is essential to study the underlying physics. To this end, the development of simulation tools to aid the risk analyst in the study of system level behavior is elucidated. ROCETS (ROCket Engine Transient Simulator) simulation code was used to investigate the steady state and transient physical behavior of cryogenic rocket engines for nominal and off-nominal operating conditions.

Measurement studies show that bandwidth resources of different channels are highly unbalanced and thus recent research studies have proposed various protocols to improve the streaming qualities for all channels by enabling cross-channel cooperation among multiple channels. However, there is no general framework for comparing existing and potential designs for multi-channel P2P systems. The goal of this paper is to establish tractable models for answering the fundamental question in multi-channel system designs: Under what circumstances, should a particular design be used to achieve the desired streaming quality with the lowest implementation complexity? To achieve this goal, we first classify existing and potential designs into three categories, namely Naive Bandwidth allocation Approach (NBA), Passive Channel-aware bandwidth allocation Approach (PCA) and Active Channel-aware bandwidth allocation Approach (ACA). Then, we define the bandwidth satisfaction ratio as a performance metric to develop linear programming models for the three designs. The proposed models are independent of implementations and can be efficiently solved due to the linear property, which provides a way of numerically exploring the design space of multi-channel systems and developing closed-form solutions for special systems.},

However, there is still a lack of theoretical analysis of how good we can achieve, and what guidelines we should follow when designing schemes in case of demand heterogeneity. To shed more light on demand heterogeneity problem, we model the problem as a resource demand and supply problem. We propose an optimization method to improve bandwidth efficiency through efficient bandwidth allocation. We develop a tiered overlay and a price-rated mechanism to implement cooperation among peers, and present a framework to address the challenge via efficient bandwidth allocation and group cooperation.

	abstract = {Digital video recorder (DVR) style and non-prerecording (NPR) style are two possible implementations for P2P-based time-shifted streaming, but existing P2P streaming solutions are not suitable to implement the NPR method. Since peers can view any arbitrary video segments which have been broadcasted, they might encounter severe video quality problems and the server bandwidth consumption can become high. In this paper, we focus on minimizing the server bandwidth consumption to maintain smooth streaming service in NPR-style P2P-based time-shifted streaming. To reduce the server cost, peers prefetch segments which are not required for their current viewing. Hence even if they are viewing different parts of the video, they can exchange segments with one another. However, segment prefetching competes for bandwidth with ordinary segment fetching, and it might bring negative impact. A good prefetching solution should not affect peers' viewing experience. We formulate the problem of finding a prefetching solution as an optimization problem, with the objective to minimize the server bandwidth consumption. Then we propose a heuristic algorithm by decomposing the global optimization problem into a set of smaller problems. Each peer runs this algorithm to determine which segments to prefetch and how to serve other peers. Simulation experiments demonstrate that our design provides P2P-based time-shifted streaming at low server bandwidth consumption.},

	abstract = {Current core networks are composed of high-end routers which are connected by high-speed fibers. These optical connections are commonly overprovisioned and in low utilization. Many of them are combined together to form bundle links or composite links and the component links are referred to as sublinks. These physical sublinks could be SONET connections, Ethernet circuits, wavelengths on a fiber, etc. And they could be shut down or brought up independently. Selectively shutting down sublinks during low traffic periods could save a large amount of energy while keeping the network topology unchanged. Based on this concept, we propose a local heuristical threshold- based method to explore the potential energy- savings in the backbone network by adjusting the number of active sublinks in bundle links. An experiment based on an Internet2 derived synthetic network was conducted to verify the performance of our method and the results show that 86\% of energy consumed on ports of core routers could be saved when setting 90.0\% as the link utilization threshold. The experiment also shows that setting 90.0\% as threshold is safe enough to avoid data loss during extreme traffic increases in this case. Compared to previous proposed ILP (Integer linear programming) based global heuristic algorithms, our local heuristic algorithm can achieve energy-savings close to the optimum and greatly reduce the response time and the risk of data loss.},

Previous work on building multi-view P2P streaming systems requires network coding in data block scheduling within each channel, since it solves the fundamental inter-channel bandwidth competition problem at the individual peer level. Therefore, it limits the migration from existing single-view systems to multi-view systems. In this paper, we propose a new protocol, called divide-and-conquer (DAC), which provides a flexible way of building multi-view P2P streaming systems based on existing single-view systems. Specifically, the DAC protocol solves the inter-channel bandwidth competition problem at the channel level based on a divide-and-conquer strategy. Our extensive packet level simulations show that our DAC protocol achieves the three design goals: flexibility, efficiency and scalability.},

	abstract = {Widely deployed peer-to-peer (P2P) live streaming systems have become a great challenge for Internet Service Providers as they consume a huge amount of bandwidth. Inspired by the fact that different users in a P2P live streaming system may watch the same channel with different window sizes which have different resolution demands, we consider the design of a P2P live-video streaming system. The design utilizes this fact to reduce the bandwidth consumption but still achieve satisfactory streaming quality. We advocate adaptive streaming: a peer’s streaming rate is commensurate with its window size. In order to maintain satisfactory streaming quality even in the case when users dynamically change their window sizes, small-window users contribute part of their bandwidth to help large-window users. We propose the general design goals, and then model and formulate the design as an optimization problem. In order to design simple and efficient systems for dynamic window resizing, we study two schemes which represent two different design philosophies: a well-balanced and more distributed method and a supernode-based method. Specifically, a scheme called partial forwarding scheme (PFS) and another scheme called partial participation scheme (PPS). Our packet-level simulation results show that both PFS and PPS are easy to implement, and achieve good performance with appropriate parameter settings. Further, we also discuss their advantages and disadvantages, and demonstrate which scheme should be used in specific scenarios.},

Then, we use extensive numerical simulations to compare the three designs for various peer population distributions, upload bandwidth distributions, and channel structures. Our analytical and simulation results show that: 1) the NBA design can rarely achieve the desired streaming quality in general cases; 2) the PCA design can achieve the same performance as the ACA design in general cases; and 3) the ACA design should be used for special applications.},

	abstract = {It is challenging to provide delay-bounded service in a large-scale P2P live streaming system since a P2P streaming system is not scalable from the perspective of playback delay. However, certain peers called subscribers are more sensitive to playback delay than other peers, and the violation of the delay bound dramatically affects their satisfaction. In this paper, we study subscriber bounded delay (SBD) problem, which aims to provide bounded delay service to subscribers and best-effort delay service to ordinary peers in a large-scale single channel P2P live streaming system. We formulate the SBD as a decision problem and prove that it is NP-Complete. Then we propose a decentralized heuristic called the high fanout promotion (HFP) algorithm, which helps the system to serve the maximum number of subscribers with delay-bounded service, and to provide best-effort delay service to remaining subscribers and ordinary peers. We evaluate its performance using simulation experiments and compare our approach with the naive greedy algorithm and the general delay minimization approaches in the literature. Our extensive packet-level simulations show that our distributed solution can serve more subscribers with bounded delay video service compared to the other two methods (17\%-50\% in our simulations). Our distributed algorithm works well in both homogeneous and heterogeneous environments, and it converges very fast.},

	abstract = {The availability and reliability of optical backbone links are very important to ensure the efficient operation of the Internet. To address the issue of data loss due to optical link failures, there is a need for an optimal recovery strategy so that the traffic can be rerouted on a backup path to the destination. This paper builds on top of our prior research efforts (Yavary Mehr et al., 2022; Zhou et al., 2017) which introduced the concept of Resource Delayed Release (RDR) by adding a new state called ”idle state” which begins when the channel has completed carrying its services so that the next request can be carried immediately instead of waiting for a new channel to be established. While RDR improves the network performance by reducing the service provisioning time and blocking probability, it does not handle link failures which are quite common in optical networks. Therefore, enhancing RDR with protection strategies will make the network more reliable and thus we investigate this topic in this work. In this paper, we evaluate four different protection methods for single link failure recovery in WDM networks (Path Protection (PP), Partial Path Protection (PPP), Segment Protection (SegP) and Link Protection (LP)) with two different routing approaches namely Shortest Path (SPath) and Greedy (G) algorithm under uniform and non-uniform traffic generated using real traffic traces collected from a local Internet Service Provider (ISP). Special attention while evaluating these protection strategies was paid to the optimization of the amount of remaining bandwidth. The performance evaluation of the network under uniform and non-uniform traffic was done over the NSFNet and COST239 topologies by employing the metrics of link and network utilization, Blocking Probability (BP), Bandwidth Blocking Probability (BBP), Recovery Time (RT) and Service Provisioning Time (SPT). Our results show that the PPP method performs the best in terms of reducing BP, BBP, and SPT compared with PP, LP, and SegP in all three topologies while utilizing RDR.},

	abstract = {A centralized Software-defined Network (SDN) controller, due to its nature, faces many issues such as a single point of failure, computational complexity growth, different types of attacks, reliability challenges and scalability concerns. One of the most common fifth generation cyber-attacks is the Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attack. Having a single SDN controller can lead to a plethora of issues with respect to latency, computational complexity in the control plane, reachability, and scalability as the network scale increases. To address these issues, state-of-the-art approaches have investigated multiple SDN controllers in the network. The placement of these multiple controllers has drawn more attention in recent studies. In our previous work, we evaluated an Entropy-based technique and a machine learning-based Support Vector Machine (SVM) to detect DDoS using a single SDN controller. In this paper, we extend our previous work to further decrease the impact of the DDoS attacks on the SDN controller. Our new technique called Hierarchical Classic Controllers (HCC) uses SVM and Entropy methods to detect abnormal traffic which can lead to network failures caused by overwhelming a single controller. Determining the number of controllers and their best placement are major contributions in our new method. Our results show that the combination of the above three methods (HCC with SVM and Entropy), in the case of a network with 3 controllers provides greater accuracy and improves the DDoS attack detection rate to 86.12\% compared to 79.03\% and 81.33\% using Entropy-based HCC and SVM-based HCC, respectively.},

	abstract = {In today's wide area networks, especially in Optical Transport Networks (OTN) with Software Defined Networking (SDN) features enabled over Wavelength Division Multiplexing (WDM), Bandwidth on Demand (BoD) is an important service that can be satisfied by dynamic end-to-end service provisioning. Service provisioning time (SPT) and Blocking Probability (BP) are critical performance metrics for the users and carriers. This paper extends the concept of the Resource Delayed Release (RDR) strategy for WDM networks. The basic idea of this strategy is to introduce a delay in releasing the optical channel, when the channel is no longer carrying any services. This delay can help speed up the provisioning time for carrying the next service request, avoiding the time usually taken to establish a new optical channel. The main goals of the RDR method are to reduce SPT and BP while simultaneously satisfying the quality of service (QoS) constraints. In this paper, we investigate the effects of uniform and non-uniform traffic on the performance of RDR strategy. For non-uniform traffic simulation, we use a mesh topology with the 14 most populous cities in USA as of 2018 and model the non-uniform traffic based on population density. Further, we introduce a new metric called the Bandwidth Blocking Probability (BBP) to measure the quality of the service offered by the network. Simulation results show advantages of using the RDR method under a wide variety of traffic scenarios for both uniform and non-uniform traffic distributions compared to the traditional method. RDR reduces SPT by 45–90\% for uniform traffic and 41–75\% for non-uniform traffic. RDR reduces BP by 35–85\% for uniform traffic and 30–75\% for non-uniform traffic. Additionally, RDR lowers BBP by 31–73\% for uniform traffic and 29–68\% for non-uniform traffic.},

Furthermore, the paper presents benchmarking results and failure recovery results from each of the considered testbeds using a variety of wireless network topologies.

This interest has exacerbated in 2020 and became a vital need during the current global pandemic. However, providing end-users of various educational backgrounds access to radio devices from a heterogeneous set of vendors is challenging. This paper introduces OneLNK, a remotely accessible testbed consisting of radio devices from three different vendors and developed using open source cloud-native technologies. End-users can access the functionalities of OneLNK from a single webpage without any local installations. Using the web URL, users can operate radio devices, set experiment parameters, observe results in real-time, and save generated experiment data for all radio devices. The interactive web UI and its working mechanism for supporting radio equipment are covered with specific experiment capabilities. A diverse set of radio equipment (mmWave, sub-GHz SDR, and sub-6GHz SDR) are facilitated to explain these capabilities. Moreover, measurements of path loss, Received Signal Strength (RSS), and Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR) using devices from three different vendors operating on a vast spectrum (568 MHz, 5.8 GHz, and 60 GHz) are reported. The majority of the remotely accessible OneLNK platform was developed remotely during the pandemic by a team of experts from five U.S. states.},

Typically, services are replicated across clusters to ensure resilience. However, end-to-end service performance varies mainly depending on the service loads experienced by individual clusters. Therefore, a key challenge is to optimize end-to-end service performance by routing service requests to clusters with the least service processing/response times. We present a two-phase approach that combines an optimized multi-layer optical routing system with service mesh performance costs to improve end-to-end service performance. Our experimental strategy shows that leveraging a multi-layer architecture in combination with service performance information improves end-to-end performance.

	abstract = {Network availability is an important requirement in an optical telecommunication network. To overcome a disconnection, preparing a backup path before failure happens is required to reroute the affected traffic. This prevents any failure causing a significant amount of data loss or interruption in Wavelength Division Multiplexing (WDM) networks. Resource Delayed Release (RDR) is a new idea to improve the Service Provisioning Time (SPT) by adding the concept of idle optical channels. In earlier work [1] we proved that the delay in the removal of an idle optical channel helps the next service request to be carried immediately. In this paper, we address the problem of single link failure in WDM networks by comparing different protection methods when applied to the RDR strategy. We investigate and compare three algorithms that are mostly intended for maximization of the amount of remaining bandwidth over a damaged network. They are: Path Protection (PP), Link Protection (LP), and Partial Path Protection (PPP) [2]. The objective of this work is to apply the above protection methods on the RDR strategy to determine which method provides the best network performance in terms of Bandwidth Blocking Probability (BBP), Blocking Probability (BP), Service Provisioning Time (SPT), and recovery time (RT). Our simulation results show high network efficiency when using the RDR strategy with the PPP method for uniform traffic distribution. The highest BBP is when we do not apply any protection on RDR. When PPP is utilized there is a reduction of 58\% in BBP, of 64\% in BP, and of 40\% in SPT. Additionally RDR with PPP results in the lowest RT measured.},

The IPN is our only portal to the deep space, and yet it has been relatively sparse, until recently. With the ongoing and the planned missions to the outer space, the Delay Tolerant Networking (DTN) based network infrastructure will require more scalable routing and scheduling algorithms. In this paper, we propose the first Mixed Integer Linear Programming (MILP) model for message routing and scheduling in the IPN using Multi-Attribute Decision Making (MADM) principles. Based on this model, we propose a novel MADM-based algorithm called Multi-Attribute Routing and Scheduling (MARS) algorithm. This algorithm uses a sliding window of size n to schedule the first n messages in the buffer based on multiple attributes. After finding the optimal schedule for these messages (in terms of delivery rate), they are routed using our proposed Dijkstra-based routing algorithm. We use an existing MADM technique, PROMETHEE II, and consider the four main attributes of a message: size, priority, time to live (TTL), and time in buffer (TiB). Finally, we run multiple simulation experiments in order to test the performance of the proposed MARS and show that MADM coupled with scheduling and routing in IPN delivers at least three times more messages than a previously proposed technique, the Contact Graph Routing (CGR), while significantly reducing the average end-to-end delay and overhead.},

	abstract = {Globally, there is a significant rise in the number of connected devices. Every device has an access to wide variety of telecom services among which voice, video and best effort (BE) contribute significantly. There is a noticeable growing trend towards upstream BE traffic besides real time e-services that demand high quality of service (QoS). Converged next-generation fiber-wireless (FiWi) access networks composed of next-generation passive optical network (XG-PON) and 802.11n based wireless local area network (WLAN) has emerged as a suitable choice to provide high quality and affordable e-services to plenty of subscribers as they possess both high bandwidth and flexibility. In this paper, we study the performance of the integrated network architecture which combines XG-PON and enhanced distributed channel access (EDCA) under real time bursty traffic derived from the current global IP traffic distribution. The joint tuning of various crucial parameters of both XG-PON and EDCA with incorporation of an efficient deficit dynamic bandwidth algorithm (DBA) at optical line terminal (OLT) is done by exhaustive simulations in network simulator-3 (NS-3). Through intensive simulations and tuning, we are able to achieve a end-to-end delay performance of {\textbackslash}textless; 150 ms for voice, {\textbackslash}textless; 500 ms for video and a few seconds for BE upto full capacity. Also, a packet loss ratio (PLR) of {\textbackslash}textless; 3\% and {\textbackslash}textless; 6\% is achieved for voice and BE respectively upto full load. For voice PLR is {\textbackslash}textless; 1\% upto 60\% total offered load. Further, it is observed that the fine tuning of key parameters has also resulted in increased bandwidth for dominant BE services. Therefore, this optimized network architecture is 20\% more fair to BE services as compared to the conventional integrated FiWi architectures.},

	abstract = {Named Data Networking (NDN) is one of the promising future internet architectures, which focuses on the data rather than its location (IP/host-based system). NDN has several characteristics which facilitate addressing and routing the data: fail-over, in-network caching and load balancing. This makes it useful in areas such as managing scientific data across a distributed infrastructure. The Compact Muon Solenoid (CMS) experiment on the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) runs such an infrastructure and has a data access pattern amenable to Information-Centric Networking (ICN). In this paper, we propose SDTMA-NDN (Scientific Data Transfer Management Architecture using NDN) to distribute CMS’s software to worker-nodes and end-users. We provide several strategies to enhance the performance of NDN in transferring the scientific data. We build this on top of CERN Virtual Machine File System (CVMFS), a global, distributed filesystem designed to be used with cache-friendly workloads. CVMFS maintains its data by using content-addressable storage, which makes it suitable for NDN and a reasonable starting point for CMS. We examine the effect of in-network caching of NDN on the latency, how NDN provides transparent path selection to avoid high latency in the path, and how it balances several paths for retrieving the data. We compare SDTMA-NDN to the HTTP proxies used in the existing CVMFS-Content Distribution Network (CDN). Also, we propose two NDN forwarding strategies for retrieving the data; NDN Best-Path strategy (NDN-BP) and NDN Multi-path strategy (NDN-MP). SDTMA-NDN shows a better performance than the existing HTTP protocol in transferring the data. Further, it shows more resiliency and outperforms CVMFS-CDN under different network conditions.},

	abstract = {Named Data Networking (NDN) proposes a contentcentric rather than a host-centric approach to data retrieval. Data packets with unique and immutable names are retrieved from a content store (CS) using Interest packets. The current NDN architecture relies on forwarding strategies that are dependent upon on-path caching and is therefore inefficient. This approach reduces data transfer efficiency by ignoring the cached content available on the adjacent off-path routers in the network. In this paper, we propose a novel distributed multipath (D-MP) forwarding strategy and enhancements to the NDN Interest forwarding pipeline. Furthermore, we develop a centralized SDNenabled control for the multipath forwarding strategy (S-MP) that distributes Interests efficiently by using the global knowledge of the NDN network states. We perform extensive evaluations of our proposed methods on an at-scale WAN testbed spanning six geographically separated sites. Our solutions outperform the existing NDN forwarding strategies by a significant margin. We show that the D-MP strategy results in performance gains ranging between 10.4x to 12.5x over the default NDN implementation without in-network caching, and gains of 12.2x to 18.4x with in-network caching. In addition, for the S-MP case, we demonstrate a performance improvement of 10.6x to 12.6x, and 12.9x to 18.5x, for with- and without in-network caching respectively.},

Predictive analytics and forecasting play an important role in providing effective resource allocation strategies for large data transfers. We propose a predictive analytics solution for large data transfers using an application-aware software defined networking (SDN) approach. We perform extensive exploratory data analysis to characterize the GridFTP connection transfers dataset and present various strategies for its use with statistical forecasting models. We develop a univariate autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA) based prediction framework for forecasting GridFTP connection transfers. Our prediction model tightly integrates with an application-aware SDN solution to preemptively drive network management decisions for GridFTP resource allocation at a U.S. CMS Tier-2 site. Further, our framework has a mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) ranging from 6\% to 10\% when applied to make rolling forecasts.},

Besides real time entertainment services, there is also a rapid increase in demand to deliver best-effort services such as voice over internet protocol (VoIP), offline viewing, file sharing, and web browsing in a cost-efficient manner. Integrated fiber-wireless (FiWi) broadband access networks have emerged as a promising broadband access technology that can provide high quality e-services to large number of distributed wireless subscribers. In this paper, we deal with a converged 10-Gigabit capable passive optical network (XG-PON) and an enhanced distributed channel access (EDCA) based Wi-Fi architecture that incorporates an efficient deficit dynamic bandwidth allocation (DBA) algorithm at the optical line terminal (OLT) to support different Quality of Service (QoS) needs of users efficiently. The performance evaluation of the integrated network is carried out in the NS-3 simulator and the results are reported in terms of delay and fairness index.

Network functions can be dynamically managed to provide the necessary services on-demand and further, services can be chained together to form a larger composite. In this paper, we address an important technical problem of mapping service function chains (SFCs) across different data centers with the objective of reducing the flow processing costs. We develop an integer linear programming (ILP) formulation to optimally map service function chains to multiple data centers while adhering to the data center's capacity constraints. We propose a novel application-aware flow reduction (AAFR) algorithm to simplify the SFC-ILP to significantly reduce the number of flows processed by the SFCs. We perform a thorough study of the SFC mapping problem for multiple data centers and evaluate the performance of our proposed approach with respect to three parameters: i) impact of number of SFCs and SFC length on flow processing cost, ii) capacitated/uncapacitated flow processing cost gains, and iii) balancing flow-to-SFC mappings across data centers. Our evaluations show that our proposed AAFR algorithm reduces flow-processing costs by 70\% for the capacitated-SFC mapping case over the SFC-ILP. In addition, our uncapacitated AAFR (AAFR-U) algorithm provides a further 4.1\% cost-gain over its capacitated counterpart (AAFR-C).},

Participants rated the ease of use (clarity of functions and ease of navigations) of the ENMN app as relatively high. Mothers expressed satisfaction in learning the ENMN app quickly and easily. Mothers’ responses were mixed regarding the acceptability of the ENMN app. Two mothers appreciated the visual results of creating their own username and avatar for the ENMN app. In contrast, some mothers reported the ENMN app should be made more visually interesting before the app is used in future studies.},

The Interplanetary Network (IPN), hence, has to undergo many structural changes, as the traffic loads and types will drastically increase. In this paper, we propose N-Look Ahead Routing and Scheduling (N-LARS), a novel scheduling and routing technique for DTN-based IPNs with these new challenges. Our N-LARS model for Delay Tolerant Networking (DTN)-based IPNs provides scheduling of bundles (also called requests or messages) and efficient routing across the overall network. We develop a mixed integer linear programming (MILP) formulation for N-LARS problem and solve it using CPLEX. We further derive a heuristic that scales better than the MILP for large networks. We run experiments on networks mimicking the proposed Mars project by the European Space Agency. Finally, we compare the performance of the network using our scheduling model to its performance using the usual routing technique such as the Contact Graph Routing (CGR). Our simulation results show that the overall performance of the network using N-LARS for bundle scheduling and routing is four times better than CGR, in terms of delivered bundles, and 13.8\% closer to the sub- optimal schedule generated by the CPLEX solver.},

This network has very different communication conditions than the networks deployed on the surface of Earth. The large delays, intermittent connections and rough environment in space require the adoption of the Delay/Disruption Tolerant Network architecture/techniques. The currently used implementation of DTN interplanetary networks uses the Contact Graph Routing mechanism that we show, using the Interplanetary Overlay Network (ION) based experiments, has some shortcomings leading to less efficient use of the network. In this paper, we propose a novel model to represent such networks based on temporal graphs obtaining a near-real-time representation of these deterministic dynamic networks. This Modified Temporal Graph (MTG) model is then used for the implementation of our proposed routing algorithm, the Earliest Arrival Optimal Delivery Ratio (EAODR) routing algorithm. We provide the proof of correctness of EAODR, and we use our routing simulator to run experiments on a real-world network and also on large networks. We prove that EAODR outperforms the Contact Graph Routing (CGR) in terms of a decrease in delay of up to 12.9\%.},

With the increasing importance of the network bandwidth in the Cloud environment, the networking related resources need to be optimally allocated together with the traditional Cloud computing resources. In addition, the significant growth of the global data center traffic raises the challenge of supporting demands with large bandwidth requirements for the Cloud provider. In our paper, we consider the network-efficient virtualized cloud infrastructure provisioning problem in IP over elastic optical network (IP-over-EON) based on the data center as a service model. The elastic optical network is adopted to provide spectrum and cost-efficient networking resources for large bandwidth requests in our work. We develop mixed integer linear programming formulations to construct the mathematic model for this problem and propose a costoptimized heuristic to solve this problem. To investigate the cost and blocking rate for the served demands, different modulation formats are compared in the EON layer, and the sliceable bandwidth-variable transponders and optical traffic grooming technology are considered. The experimental results show that different modulation formats that are adopted in the EON layer will have different impacts on the total cost and demand blocking rate for the same data set size. Also the use of SBVT will reduce the total cost no matter which modulation format is adopted, and the reduction is related to the bandwidth requirement of the demands},

Manual configuration of multiple devices is being replaced by an automated approach where a software-based, network-aware controller handles the configuration of all network devices. Software applications running on top of the network controller provide an abstraction of the topology and facilitate the task of operating the network. We propose OpenSec, an OpenFlow-based security framework that allows a network security operator to create and implement security policies written in human-readable language. Using OpenSec, the user can describe a flow in terms of OpenFlow matching fields, define which security services must be applied to that flow (deep packet inspection, intrusion detection, spam detection, etc.) and specify security levels that define how OpenSec reacts if malicious traffic is detected. In this paper, we first provide a more detailed explanation of how OpenSec converts security policies into a series of OpenFlow messages needed to implement such a policy. Second, we describe how the framework automatically reacts to security alerts as specified by the policies. Third, we perform additional experiments on the GENI testbed to evaluate the scalability of the proposed framework using existing datasets of campus networks. Our results show that up to 95\% of attacks in an existing data set can be detected and 99\% of malicious source nodes can be blocked automatically. Furthermore, we show that our policy specification language is simpler while offering fast translation times compared to existing solutions.},

However, the problem of efficient data transfer across the network core has not been adequately investigated. We tackle the challenge of inter-domain cut-through switching using software-defined networking (SDN). First, we propose and solve an optimization problem that minimizes the total transfer time using inter-domain tunnels. Second, we propose an SDN-based routing framework for the MobilityFirst architecture capable of dynamically creating such tunnels. The main novelty of this framework is to name tunnels as network objects to simplify how tunnels are created and maintained. To validate our framework, we implement on the GENI (Global Environment for Network Innovations) testbed a prototype for the MobilityFirst architecture. Our experiments with the optimization problem show that the inter-domain latency between controllers plays a key role on how tunnels are setup. Furthermore, our implementation experiments show that the control plane delay can be reduced by 75\% when using inter-domain tunnels. Finally, we show how our framework needs fewer messages than current protocols such as label distribution protocol (LDP) to setup intra-domain and inter-domain tunnels.},

	abstract = {We propose a multi-layer energy saving technique for optical core networks that aims at reducing energy consumption by powering off components in different layers of the network After obtaining satisfactory results in saving energy by powering off ports in the IP layer in our previous work in this paper we target more savings by considering additional layers in the network. The model proposed in this paper is a heuristic that bases the capacity prediction for a future time slot on the number of 40G links needed in the current time slot. It also revolves around four parameters for which the values are empirically set. We set two thresholds, low and high, as well as the number of links to power off or power on each time the utilization is below or above a threshold. We assess our model through experiments featuring an Internet2-like topology and a real one-day worth of traffic split into five-minute time slots. The results offer a comparison between different parameters settings and how they affect energy savings and the number of overflows in the network that result from mis-prediction.

We present Remote Mobile Screen (RMS), an approach for secure BYOD environments that addresses all these challenges. In order to achieve this, the enterprise provides the employee with a trusted virtual machine running a mobile operating system, which is located in the enterprise network and to which the employee connects using the mobile BYOD device.

Manual configuration of multiple devices is being replaced by an automated approach where a software-based, network-aware controller handles the configuration of all network devices. Software applications running on top of the network controller provide an abstraction of the topology and facilitate the task of operating the network. We propose OpenSec, an OpenFlow-based security framework that allows a network security operator to create and implement security policies written in human-readable language. Using OpenSec, the user can describe a flow in terms of OpenFlow matching fields, define which security services must be applied to that flow (deep packet inspection, intrusion detection, spam detection, etc) and specify security levels that define how OpenSec reacts if malicious traffic is detected. We implement OpenSec in the GENI testbed to evaluate the flexibility, accuracy and scalability of the framework. The experimental setup includes deep packet inspection, intrusion detection and network quarantining to secure a web server from network scanners. We achieve a constant delay when reacting to security alerts and a detection rate of 98\%.},

	abstract = {The availability and reliability of optical backbone links are very important to ensure the efficient operation of the Internet. To address the issue of data loss due to optical link failures, there is a need for an optimal recovery strategy so that the traffic can be rerouted on a backup path to the destination. This paper builds on top of our prior research efforts (Yavary Mehr et al., 2022; Zhou et al., 2017) which introduced the concept of Resource Delayed Release (RDR) by adding a new state called ”idle state” which begins when the channel has completed carrying its services so that the next request can be carried immediately instead of waiting for a new channel to be established. While RDR improves the network performance by reducing the service provisioning time and blocking probability, it does not handle link failures which are quite common in optical networks. Therefore, enhancing RDR with protection strategies will make the network more reliable and thus we investigate this topic in this work. In this paper, we evaluate four different protection methods for single link failure recovery in WDM networks (Path Protection (PP), Partial Path Protection (PPP), Segment Protection (SegP) and Link Protection (LP)) with two different routing approaches namely Shortest Path (SPath) and Greedy (G) algorithm under uniform and non-uniform traffic generated using real traffic traces collected from a local Internet Service Provider (ISP). Special attention while evaluating these protection strategies was paid to the optimization of the amount of remaining bandwidth. The performance evaluation of the network under uniform and non-uniform traffic was done over the NSFNet and COST239 topologies by employing the metrics of link and network utilization, Blocking Probability (BP), Bandwidth Blocking Probability (BBP), Recovery Time (RT) and Service Provisioning Time (SPT). Our results show that the PPP method performs the best in terms of reducing BP, BBP, and SPT compared with PP, LP, and SegP in all three topologies while utilizing RDR.},

	abstract = {OpenFlow is currently the most commonly deployed Software Defined Networking (SDN) technology. SDN consists of decoupling the control and data planes of a network. A software-based controller is responsible for managing the forwarding information of one or more switches; the hardware only handles the forwarding of traffic according to the rules set by the controller. OpenFlow is an SDN technology proposed to standardize the way that a controller communicates with network devices in an SDN architecture. It was proposed to enable researchers to test new ideas in a production environment. OpenFlow provides a specification to migrate the control logic from a switch into the controller. It also defines a protocol for the communication between the controller and the switches. As discussed in this survey paper, OpenFlow-based architectures have specific capabilities that can be exploited by researchers to experiment with new ideas and test novel applications. These capabilities include software-based traffic analysis, centralized control, dynamic updating of forwarding rules and flow abstraction. OpenFlow-based applications have been proposed to ease the configuration of a network, to simplify network management and to add security features, to virtualize networks and data centers and to deploy mobile systems. These applications run on top of networking operating systems such as Nox, Beacon, Maestro, Floodlight, Trema or Node.Flow. Larger scale OpenFlow infrastructures have been deployed to allow the research community to run experiments and test their applications in more realistic scenarios. Also, studies have measured the performance of OpenFlow networks through modelling and experimentation. We describe the challenges facing the large scale deployment of OpenFlow-based networks and we discuss future research directions of this technology.},

	abstract = {To address the reliability challenges due to failures and planned outages, Internet Service Providers (ISPs) typically use two backbone routers at each central office to which access routers connected in a dual-homed configuration. At the IP layer, redundant backbone routers and redundant transport equipment to interconnect them are deployed, providing reliability through node and path diversity. However, adding such redundant resources increases the overall cost of the network. Hence, a fundamental redesign of the backbone network avoiding such redundant resources, by leveraging the capabilities of an agile optical transport network, is highly desired. In this paper, we propose such a fundamental redesign of IP backbones. Our alternative design uses only a single router at each office but uses the agile optical transport layer to carry traffic to remote Backbone Routers (BRs) in order to survive failures or outages of the single local BR. Optimal mapping of local Access Routers (ARs) to remote BRs is determined by solving an Integer Linear Program (ILP). We describe how our proposed design can be realized using current optical transport technology. We evaluate network designs for cost and performability, the latter being a metric combining performance and availability. We show significant reduction in cost for approximately the same level of reliability as current designs.},

In this paper, we propose a novel and practical two-step approach: pre-processing with Integer Linear Programming (ILP) for absolutely or maximally SRLG-diverse routes and post-processing for DWDM system selection, regenerator placement and wavelength assignment. This approach has been implemented in a production network planning tool. According to our experiments, for a typical large carrier’s core optical network, most of the diverse-routing demands can be solved within 1min, even with tens of thousands of binary decision variables, which allows interactive use by network planners.},

However, service providers are still facing the challenges arising from the special requirements for provisioning services at the optical layer. In this paper, we incorporate some realistic constraints into the static provisioning problem, and formulate it under different network resource availability conditions. We consider three classes of shared risk link group (SRLG)-diverse path protection schemes: dedicated, shared, and unprotected. We associate with each connection request a lightpath length constraint and a revenue value. When the network resources are not sufficient to accommodate all the connection requests, the static provisioning problem is formulated as a revenue maximization problem, whose objective is maximizing the total revenue value. When the network has sufficient resources, the problem becomes a capacity minimization problem with the objective of minimizing the number of used wavelength-links. We give integer linear programming (ILP) formulations for these problems. Because solving these ILP problems is extremely time consuming, we propose a tabu search heuristic to solve these problems within a reasonable time. Experimental results are presented to compare the solutions obtained by an ILP solver, the tabu search heuristic and a divide-and-conquer greedy heuristic.},

Signaling is used to support connection setup, maintenance, and teardown in such a network. In this paper, we study the performance of two hop-by-hop and one parallel signaling schemes in wavelength-routed optical mesh networks. Based on the sequence between optical crossconnect (OXC) switching and signaling message processing, we classify hop-by-hop signaling into two types that comply with the requirements of GMPLS signaling protocols. These two types are forward before switching configuration (FBSC) and forward after switching configuration (FASC). Also, we propose a parallel signaling scheme that is different from the existing hop-by-hop GMPLS signaling protocols. Considering OXC architectures and traffic patterns, we compare the FBSC, FASC, and parallel signaling schemes using simulation experiments, in terms of network blocking probability and reservation time. The simulation data reveal that the performance of a signaling scheme depends on the nature of the signaling as well as the network setting (e.g., the OXC architecture and traffic pattern). We analyze reasons for this result and discuss tradeoffs between these signaling schemes. This work offers some insight into designing an efficient signaling protocol for wavelength-routed optical mesh networks.},

Given the network resources, the objective of the STG problem is to maximize network throughput. To enable survivability under various kinds of single failures such as fiber cut and duct cut, we consider the general shared risk link group (SRLG) diverse routing constraints. We first resort to the integer linear programming (ILP) approach to obtain optimal solutions. To address its high computational complexity, we then propose three efficient heuristics, namely separated survivable grooming algorithm (SSGA), integrated survivable grooming algorithm (ISGA) and tabu search survivable grooming algorithm (TSGA). While SSGA and ISGA correspond to an overlay network model and a peer network model respectively, TSGA further improves the grooming results from SSGA and ISGA by incorporating the effective tabu search method. Numerical results show that the heuristics achieve comparable solutions to the ILP approach, which uses significantly longer running times than the heuristics.},

In this work we study the problem of survivable routing of a virtual topology on a physical topology with shared risk link groups (SRLG).

We prove that survivable virtual topology routing problem against SRLG/node failures is also NP-complete. We present an improved integer linear programming (ILP) formulation (in comparison to E. Modiano and A. Narula-Tam, May 2002) for computing the survivable routing under SRLG/node failures. Using an ILP solver, we computed the survivable virtual topology routing against link and SRLG failures for small and medium sized networks efficiently. As even our improved ILP formulation becomes intractable for large networks, we present a congestion-based heuristic and a tabu search heuristic (which uses the congestion-based heuristic solution as the initial solution) for computing survivable routing of a virtual topology. Our experimental results show that tabu search heuristic coupled with the congestion based heuristic (used as initial solution) provides fast and near-optimal solutions.},

	abstract = {This paper addresses the problem of survivable lightpath provisioning in wavelength-division-multiplexing (WDM) mesh networks, taking into consideration optical-layer protection and some realistic optical signal quality constraints. The investigated networks use sparsely placed optical-electrical-optical (O/E/O) modules for regeneration and wavelength conversion. Given a fixed network topology with a number of sparsely placed O/E/O modules and a set of connection requests, a pair of link-disjoint lightpaths is established for each connection. Due to physical impairments and wavelength continuity,both the working and protection lightpaths need to be regenerated at some intermediate nodes to overcome signal quality degradation and wavelength contention. In the present paper, resource-efficient provisioning solutions are achieved with the objective of maximizing resource sharing. The authors propose a resource-sharing scheme that supports three kinds of resource-sharing scenarios, including a conventional wavelength-link sharing scenario, which shares wavelength links between protection lightpaths, and two new scenarios, which share O/E/O modules between protection lightpaths and between working and protection lightpaths. An integer linear programming (ILP)-based solution approach is used to find optimal solutions. The authors also propose a local optimization heuristic approach and a tabu search heuristic approach to solve this problem for real-world,large mesh networks. Numerical results show that our solution approaches work well under a variety of network settings and achieves a high level of resource-sharing rates (over 60\% for O/E/O modules and over 30\% for wavelength links), which translate into great savings in network costs.},

A majority of applications require cooperation of two or more independently designed, separately located, but mutually affecting subsystems.

Such a co-ordination can permit the use of commercially designed subsystems to perform more sophisticated tasks than at present and improve the operational reliability. However, such a co-ordination is very difficult to attain mainly due to the lack of precise system models and/or dynamic parameters. In such situations, the evolvable hardware (EHW) techniques, which can achieve the sophisticated level of information processing the brain is capable of, can excel. In this paper, a new multiple-sensor coordinator based sensor validation scheme combining the techniques of evolvable hardware and neural networks, is presented. The idea of this work is to develop a system that is resistant or tolerant to sensor failures (fault tolerance) by utilizing multiple sensor inputs connected to a programmable VLSI chip. The proposed system can be views as process modeling formalism and given the appropriate network topology; is capable of characterizing non linear functional relationships. The structure of the resulting evolvable hardware based process model can be considered generic, in the sense that little prior process knowledge is required. The knowledge about the plant dynamics and mapping characteristics are implicitly stored within the network. The proposed system help in extending the range of operation of the conventional control systems with respect to sensor validation at no extra (hardware) costs. The proposed design algorithms focus on using the characteristics that evolved systems present like, for example adaptation, auto-regulation and learning. The proposed sensor was tested for its effectiveness by introducing different sensor failures such as: sensor fails as open circuit, sensor fails as short circuit, multiple sensor failure etc. on a real time plant and in each case the performance index was computed and found to be acceptable.},

	abstract = {The static provisioning problem in wavelength-routed optical networks has been studied for many years. However, service providers are still facing the challenges arising from the special requirements for provisioning services at the optical layer. In this paper, we incorporate some realistic constraints into the static provisioning problem, and formulate it under different network resource availability conditions. We consider three classes of shared risk link group (SRLG)-diverse path protection schemes: dedicated, shared, and unprotected. We associate with each connection request a lightpath length constraint and a revenue value. When the network resources are not sufficient to accommodate all the connection requests, the static provisioning problem is formulated as a revenue maximization problem, whose objective is maximizing the total revenue value. When the network has sufficient resources, the problem becomes a capacity minimization problem with the objective of minimizing the number of used wavelength-links. We provide integer linear programming (ILP) formulations for these problems. Because solving these ILP problems is extremely time consuming, we propose a tabu search heuristic to solve these problems within a reasonable amount of time. We also develop a rerouting optimization heuristic, which is based on previous work. Experimental results are presented to compare the solutions obtained by the tabu search heuristic and the rerouting optimization heuristic. For both problems, the tabu search heuristic outperforms the rerouting optimization heuristic.},

Two dedicated path-protection schemes are proposed, namely the PBABL scheme and the MPABWL scheme. The PBABL scheme protects each working waveband-path through a backup waveband-path. The MPABWL scheme protects each working waveband-path by either a backup waveband-path or multiple backup lightpaths. Heuristic algorithms adopting random optimization technique are proposed for both the schemes. The performance of the two protection schemes is studied and compared. Simulation results show that both the heuristics can obtain optimum solutions and the MPABWL scheme leads to less switching and transmission costs than the PBABL scheme.},

This paper proposes the ECDLP-based Diffie-Hellman protocols for secure group communication and evaluates their performance on wireless ad hoc networks. The proposed schemes are compared at the same security level with DLP-based group protocols under different channel conditions. Our experiments and analysis show that the Tree-based Group Elliptic Curve Diffie-Hellman (TGECDH) protocol is the best in overall performance for secure group communication among the four schemes discussed in the paper. Low communication overhead, relatively low computation load and short packets are the main reasons for the good performance of the TGECDH protocol.},

The efficiency and user satisfaction highly depend on the constructed overlays. The common neighbor selection algorithms in existing overlay construction schemes usually randomly select a fixed number of neighbors which satisfy the selection requirements, such as end-to-end delay or a peerpsilas sojourn time. However, this fixed random neighbor-selection algorithm (FRNS) neglects the peerspsila upload bandwidth heterogeneity and therefore, the upload bandwidth cannot be efficiently used. In this paper, we propose a variable random neighbor-selection (VRNS) scheme to alleviate the problems due to bandwidth heterogeneity, and in which the number of neighbors with different upload bandwidths is dynamically determined by the statistical bandwidth information of the system. Our proposed scheme is shown to outperform FRNS based upon a large volume of carefully designed simulations.},

We first empirically study statistical properties of such videos and find that hot-event videos contribute a large number of views, even though the total number of hot-event videos is relatively small. In addition, there exist extremely active uploaders and top 10\% active uploaders upload over 60\% videos. The video popularity demonstrates high skewness, where top 5\% the most popular videos contribute over 80\% views. Finally, we analyze the popularity evolution of hot-event videos using the consecutive 28-day video traces. The popularity of the studied videos decays very fast and most of these videos remain popular for only a week. Our findings reflect the most recent developments of UGC sites, which provide technical and commercial insights for engineers and UGC site owners.},

This approach has been implemented in a prototype network planning tool.

In this work, a service-differentiated real-time communication scheme (SDRCS) is developed to provide soft real-time guarantees for event-based traffic in WSNs. SDRCS features a cross-layer packet forwarding design to integrate the real-time routing functionality with a novel prioritized medium access control scheme. Based on this design, SDRCS performs distributed packet traversal speed estimation for traffic classification and admission control. SDRCS also performs prioritized packet forwarding so that the routing decisions are locally performed for maximized packet traversal speed. SDRCS requires no extra hardware for localization, transmission power adaptation or multi-channel transmission. It also adapts well to network dynamics, such as channel quality and communication voids. Performance evaluations show that SDRCS significantly improves the on-time delivery ratio and service-differentiation granularity for mixed priority traffic flows in unsynchronized WSNs, compared with currently used communication schemes. SDRCS also provides higher end-to-end throughput in terms of supporting higher source data rates with tight end-to-end latency requirements.},

First, the deployment of middleboxes in choke points (between two routers through which all traffic flows), raises concerns regarding robustness, correctness and efficiency. Second, dynamically managing traffic isolation in a network is a very tedious task. In this paper we propose using Software Defined Networks (SDN) and OpenFlow to simplify network management by addressing these two challenges. SDN consists of decoupling the control and data planes of a network. OpenFlow standardizes the way that the controller communicates with the network devices in an SDN architecture. To overcome the challenge faced by deploying middleboxes in choke points, we show how these appliances can be deployed at waypoints. In this architecture, a waypoint is only traversed by traffic that needs further processing. The remaining data flows through the network without being processed by the middlebox. We have developed an application that implements an encryption processing unit that works as a waypoint and we show how OpenFlow can be used to route through the encryption unit only the traffic that requires encryption. To overcome the challenge of dynamic traffic isolation, we show how a network manager can use an application to create, delete and modify virtual local area networks (VLANs) in a dynamic way to achieve traffic isolation. Our implementation provides a GUI to the user so that the administration of the VLANs is greatly simplified.},

	abstract = {Increasingly, academic campus networks support large-scale data transfer workflows for data-intensive science. These data transfers rely on high-performance, scalable, and reliable protocols for moving large amounts of data over a high-bandwidth, high-latency network. GridFTP is a widely used protocol for wide area network (WAN) data movement. However, as the GridFTP protocol does not share connection information with the network-layer, network operators have reduced flexibility, particularly in identifying/managing flows across the network. We address this problem by deploying a production “ application-aware ” software defined network (SDN) for managing GridFTP transfers for data-intensive science workflows. We first propose a novel application-aware architecture called SNAG (SDN-managed Network Architecture for GridFTP transfers). SNAG combines application-layer and network-layer collaboration (termed “application-awareness”) with SDN-enabled network management to classify, monitor and to manage network resources actively. Until now, our SNAG deployment has successfully classified over 1.5 Billion GridFTP connections at the Holland Computing Center (HCC), University of Nebraska-Lincoln (UNL). Next, we develop an application-aware SDN system to provide differentiated network services for distributed computing workflows. At HCC, we also demonstrate how our system ensures the quality of service (QoS) for high-throughput workflows such as Compact Muon Solenoid (CMS) and Laser Interferometer Gravitational-Wave Observatory (LIGO). Further, we also demonstrate how application-aware SDN can be exploited to create policy-driven approaches to achieve accurate resource accounting for each workflow. We present strategies for implementing differentiated network services and discuss their capacity improvement benefits. Lastly, we provide some guidelines and recommendations for developing application-aware SDN architectures for general-purpose applications.},

This is achieved by using an optical route planning library called GNPy (Gaussian Noise model in python) as the calculation model within SIMON. SIMON is implemented in C++ and has mainly been used as an optical network learning tool for studying the performance of wavelength-routed optical networks. It measures the network blocking probability by taking into consideration the optical device characteristics. SIMON can capture the most significant impairments when estimating the Bit-Error Rate (BER) but does not consider fiber dispersion and non-linearities. These impairments can be significant when simulating a large-scale network. GNPy, on the other hand, considers those physical impairments and can give a more accurate signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) estimation validated by real-world measurements. By integrating GNPy with SIMON, we are able to set a minimum SNR threshold, which must be satisfied by any call set up in the network. The integration of SIMON and GNPy makes the resulting simulator not only suitable for academic learning but also valuable for real-world network planning, evaluation, and deployment of optical networks.},

	abstract = {A variety of DBA (Dynamic Bandwidth Allocation) and DWBA (Dynamic Wavelength and Bandwidth Allocation) algorithms have been proposed which are based on different PONs (e.g. EPON, GPON, XG-PON, 10G-EPON, etc.). But to our knowledge, no DWBA scheme for NG-PON2 system, with diverse customers and prioritized traffic, has been proposed yet. In this work, this problem is addressed and we focus on the wavelength assignment part, assuming that the system applies conventional DBA method described in the standard ITU-T G.989. Considering this assumption, we propose five different dynamic wavelength and bandwidth allocation (DWBA) schemes. First, mixed integer linear programming (MILP) models are developed to minimize the total delay of the high priority data. Due to the MILP’s high computational complexity, heuristic algorithms are developed based on the MILP model insights. The five heuristics algorithms are: No Block-Split Heuristic (NBH), Equal Block-Split Heuristic (EBH), Priority Based No Block-Split Heuristic (P-NBH), Priority Based Equal Block-Split Heuristic (P-EBH), and Priority Based Decider Block-Split Heuristic (P-DBH). Six priority classes of requests are introduced with the goal of minimizing the total delay for the high priority data and to lessen the bandwidth wastage of the system. Finally, experiments for the performance evaluation of the five DWBA schemes are conducted. The results show that P-DBH is the most efficient among the five because this scheme offers the lowest delay for high priority data and the minimum bandwidth wastage for lower priority ones.},

	abstract = {The Internet of Things (IoT) has opened large possibilities and more advanced applications, but it also increased the complexity of the network and its challenges. In this work, we are interested in statistically analyzing the predictability of connections in IoT networks in order to enhance their Quality of Service (QoS). Deep learning and classical prediction models are used to predict the dynamic spatio-temporal link availability, reduce overall path delay and improve the throughput. We are especially interested in mission-driven IoT networks (MD-IoT) such as the ones deployed in emergency and disaster relief missions, and vegetation and wildlife monitoring. In this paper, we propose a comprehensive Statistical Analysis (STAN) framework, that analyzes traces from MD-IoT networks and tests multiple deep learning and classical prediction models in order to identify the most appropriate one in terms of its applicability for the given network. We then implement a Dijkstra-based routing algorithm, PETRA, that integrates STAN's predictions. Finally, we run experiments using a dataset composed of real-life traces. We compare the performance of the two running modes of our PETRA routing algorithm to CRPO and show that PETRA can enhance the throughput by up to 29.4\%. The results also show that the overall network performance is enhanced by up to 36.7\%.},

	abstract = {The IT infrastructure of large organizations consists of devices and software services purchased from multiple vendors. The problem of measuring the quality of service (QoS) of each of these vendor devices (and services) is challenging since the vendors may tamper with the measurements for monetary benefits or saving debugging efforts. Existing solutions for QoS measurement in trusted environments cannot be extended for this problem since the vendors can easily circumvent them. Solutions borrowed from other areas such as client-server QoS measurement do not help either since they incur unreasonable storage and network overheads, or require extensive modifications to the packet headers. In this paper, we propose the Measuring Tape scheme, comprised of (1) a novel data structure called evidence Bloom filter (e-BF) that can be deployed at the vendor devices (and services), and (2) unique querying techniques, which can be used by the administrator to query the e-BF to measure QoS. While e-BF uses storage and computational resources judiciously, the querying techniques ensure resilience to adversarial behavior. We evaluate our solution based on a few real-world and synthetic traces and with different adversaries. Our results highlight the trade-off between resources (i.e., storage and computation) and the accuracy of QoS predictions, as well as its implications on security. We also present an analytical model of e-BF that establishes the relationship between storage, prediction accuracy, and security. Further, we present security arguments to illustrate how our solution thwarts adversarial attempts to tamper QoS.},

Big data plays a pivotal role in university research and impacts domains such as engineering, agriculture, natural sciences, and humanities. Over the years, numerous solutions have been proposed to manage and secure large-scale data transfers efficiently. Examples consist of the inclusion of security policies at the network edge, optimized middlebox management, and the Science Demilitarized Zone (Science DMZ). These solutions either severely degrade data transfer performance or result in data flows completely bypassing the campus network security controls. In this paper, we present our experience with the design, development, and management of large-scale data transfers using software defined networking (SDN) and network functions virtualization (NFV). We also discuss the issues and challenges associated with securing large-scale data transfers in campus networks.},

In our previous works, we have proposed and experimentally demonstrated a software-defined networking-based architecture (service-aware architecture) for converged control of packet and optical networks. In this paper, we first propose a concept called virtual transport link (VTL) to support dynamic link aggregation in software-defined IP over optical networks. Then, the VTL-based dynamic bandwidth adjustment (VTL-DBA) method is proposed for improving the resource utilization and for simplifying service provisioning. The feasibility of our proposals is experimentally verified on our software-defined IP over optical networks testbed. The performance of the VTL-DBA method is also evaluated based on our simulation platform in terms of resource usage, resource utilization, and blocking probability. For carrying quality guaranteed services, VTL-DBA saves 25\% of transport resources on average compared with static bandwidth allocation methods, and it shows an increase of 15\% in the average resource utilization. For carrying both quality guaranteed services and quality tolerant services, VTL-DBA reduces the service blocking probability to only 10\% on average with higher resource utilization than static bandwidth allocation methods.},

This makes it useful in areas such as managing scientific data across a distributed infrastructure. The CMS experiment on the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) runs such an infrastructure and has a data access pattern amenable to content-centric networking. In this paper, we propose SDTMA-NDN (Scientific Data Transfer Management Architecture using NDN) to distribute CMS's software to worker-nodes and end-users. We build on top of CERN Virtual Machine File System (CVMFS), a global, distributed filesystem designed to be used with cache-friendly workloads. CVMFS maintain its data by using content-addressable storage, which makes it suitable for NDN and a reasonable starting point for CMS. We examine the effect of in-network caching of NDN on the latency, how NDN provides transparent path selection to avoid high latency in the path, and how it balances several paths for retrieving the data. We compare SDTMA-NDN to the HTTP proxies used in the existing CVMFS-Content distribution Network (CDN). We find that SDTMA-NDN is more resilient and outperforms CVMFS-CDN in the presence of network delays, while the CVMFS-CDN outperforms SDTMA-NDN in ideal cases where there is no delay.},

Furthermore, they do not behave optimally when operated using the standards and techniques of static networks. Delay Tolerant Networking (DTN) is one of the suggested solutions to overcome these networks' challenges. The more widely used implementation of DTN uses Contact Graph Routing (CGR) to find the path from source to destination. In this paper, we identify the shortcoming of CGR that results from overlooking the future contacts and propose the Earliest Arrival Optimal Delivery Ratio (EAODR) Routing that examines all the paths both with the desired earliest departure time and in the future in order to choose the earliest arrival path from a given node. EAODR finds the route that delivers the exchanged message (a.k.a. bundle) at most at the same time as CGR's route. We propose a Modified Temporal Graph (MTG) model that provides a near-real-time representation of the deterministic dynamic networks. We base EAODR routing algorithm on the MTG model. Our results show that we can reduce the delay by 12.9\% compared to CGR when we apply our algorithm to over 50 combinations of bundle sizes and transmission times.},

The experiments are then implemented on the Global Environment for Network Innovations (GENI) testbed. Along with realistic contact plans (CP) of the nodes, this network implementation was used to run experiments testing the performance of Delay Tolerant Networking (DTN) with and without cross links between Mars orbiters. The experiments showed that in an Earth-Mars communication network using two Mars orbiters, allowing cross links between the orbiters results in increasing the amount of data transferred by roughly 9.2\%. Data sent from Mars Rover to the Earth stations also increases by 35.7\% when a third satellite (Mars Express) was added to the network without cross links. Finally, when cross links are allowed across all satellites orbiting Mars and serving as relay nodes between the Earth stations and Mars rover, the communication was enhanced by almost 46\%. We conclude that by adding cross links, the performance of the network is enhanced for a better transmission of data from Mars to the Earth, which is very pertinent for the scalability of the network.},

These applications often include the monitoring of sensitive information such as enemy movement on the battlefield or the location of personnel in a building. Security is therefore important in WSNs. However, WSNs suffer from many constraints, including low computation capability, small memory, limited energy resources, susceptibility to physical capture, and the use of insecure wireless communication channels. These constraints make security in WSNs a challenge. In this article we present a survey of security issues in WSNs. First we outline the constraints, security requirements, and attacks with their corresponding countermeasures in WSNs. We then present a holistic view of security issues. These issues are classified into five categories: cryptography, key management, secure routing, secure data aggregation, and intrusion detection. Along the way we highlight the advantages and disadvantages of various WSN security protocols and further compare and evaluate these protocols based on each of these five categories. We also point out the open research issues in each subarea and conclude with possible future research directions on security in WSNs.},

The feasibility of this technology would enable everyone to directly access telemetric data from distant planets and satellites. The concept of an Interplanetary Internet (IPN) is only in its incubation stage and considerable amount of common standards and research is required before widespread deployment can occur to make IPN feasible. Delay is an important factor in space communication and its nature is completely different from terrestrial delay environments. Moreover, space deployments and testing in space environments are very costly and time consuming. We propose a design of the IPN and implement it with the Interplanetary Overlay Network (ION) software module on physical nodes on the terrestrial ORBIT testbed. Two space network scenarios are designed and experimentally evaluated to verify the correctness of the network implementation. We also focus on the study of bundle transmission delay and separately evaluate the effect of bundle size and number of bundles. The experimental evaluation provides insights into the factors which caused delay in bundle transmission such as custody refusal, expiration of bundle lifetime and congestion.},

	abstract = {Elastic optical network is introduced as a promising technology to provide multi-bitrate-friendly data transmission in the optical layer. Elastic optical networks are based on flexible modulation format conversion, which can make more efficient use of spectrum resources than current fix-grid WDM networks. In this paper, we define the routing, modulation level and spectrum resource allocation (RMLSA) problem and then propose two novel dynamic modulation level conversion (MLC) enabled RMLSA algorithms. Numerical simulations are conducted to compare the performance of the path modulation level conversion (Path-MLC) and link modulation level conversion (Link-MLC) with different MLC thresholds with K-shortest paths RSA in terms of blocking rate, occupied spectrum and the number of MLCs across two topologies. The results verify that the Link-MLC with unlimited MLC achieves the lowest blocking rate and moderate spectrum utilization at the expense of intermediate node modulation conversions in two topologies. Smaller MLC threshold has higher blocking rate and occupied less spectrum resource. The results also suggest that the Path-MLC approach is more resource efficient than the Link-MLC with relatively higher blocking rate, and this method maybe more preferable in the networks with tight budget and/or energy constraints.},

	abstract = {Mobile devices are expected to become the Internet’s predominant technology. Current protocols such as TCP/IP were not originally designed with mobility as a key consideration, and therefore underperform under challenging mobile and wireless conditions. MobilityFirst, a clean slate architecture proposal, embraces several key concepts centered around secure identifiers that inherently support mobility and trustworthiness as key requirements of the network architecture. This includes a hop-by-hop segmented data transport based on a globally unique identifier. This allows late and dynamic rebinding of end-point addresses to support mobility. While this provides critical gains in wireless segments, some overheads are incurred even in stable segments such as in the core. Bypassing routing-layer decisions in these cases, with lower layer cut-through forwarding, can improve said gains. In this work, we introduce a general bypass capability within the MobilityFirst architecture that provides better performance and enables both individual and aggregate flow-level traffic control. Furthermore, we present an OpenFlow-based proof-of-concept implementation of the bypass function using layer 2 VLAN tagging. We run experiments on the ORBIT and Global Environment for Network Innovations (GENI) testbeds to evaluate the performance and scalability of the solution. By implementing the bypass functionality, we are able to significantly reduce the number of messages processed by the controller as well as the number of flow rules that need to be pushed into the switches.},

Parameters that are studied in the planning and optimization of a space program typically include the cost, schedule, risk and performance. The measure of success of a given space program architecture depends on the ability to meet certain predefined criteria with respect to these interdependent parameters. Large programs tend to be beset with cost overruns and schedule delays arising from technical risks. A notional model of integrated mission risk, taking into account the transient trends of hardware maturation is discussed. The total time taken to accomplish the first complete mission- from the start of the campaign to the safe return of crew to the Earth is considered as a metric. This model is used to investigate how risks associated with hardware, stemming from as yet unresolved or unrealized technical issues or defects in the design, impact the schedule risk. The mission end date distribution generated by this model and the sensitivity of the solution to different levels of initial maturity for the key hardware elements is discussed. Observations regarding strategic risk mitigation are provided on the basis of this analysis.},

	abstract = {In a wavelength-routed optical network, a transmitted signal remains in the optical domain over the entire route (lightpath) assigned to it between its source and destination nodes. The optical signal may have to traverse a number of crossconnect switches (XCSs), fiber segments, and optical amplifiers, e.g., erbium-doped fiber amplifiers (EDFAs). Thus, while propagating through the network, the signal may degrade in quality as it encounters crosstalk at the XCSs and also picks up amplified spontaneous emission (ASE) noise at the EDFAs. Since these impairments continue to degrade the signal quality as it progresses towards its destination, the receiver bit error rate (BER) at the destination node might become unacceptably high. Previous work on the lightpath routing and wavelength assignment (RWA) problems assumed an ideal physical layer and ignored these transmission impairments. The mam contribution of our work is to incorporate the role the physical layer in setting up lightpaths by employing appropriate models of multi-wavelength optical devices (XCSs and EDFAs) such that the BER of a candidate lightpath can be computed to determine if this lightpath should be used for the call. Features from existing RWA algorithms are integrated with our on-line BER calculation mechanism. Our simulation studies indicate that employing BER-based call admission algorithms has a significant impact on the performance of realistic networks.},

Such high demands on capacity (bandwidth) could lead to a “bandwidth-crunch” at the core wide-area network resulting in degradation of service-quality. Fortunately, technological innovations have emerged which can provide some relief to the end-user struggling with the Internet’s well-known delay and bandwidth limitations. At the physical layer, a complete overhaul of existing networks is envisaged from electronic media (such as twisted-pair and cable) to optical fibers [1]. Optical fibers employing the promising technique of wavelength division multiplexing (WDM) can support around 1000 times the capacity of their electronic counterparts. WDM allows the simultaneous transmission of several channels on the same fiber each on a different wavelength (frequency) [2, 3, 4]. WDM is already being deployed in commercial point-to-point fiber links including undersea installations. WDM-based optical networks are currently being tested in the U.S. (e.g., MОNЕТ, NТONC projects) [5] and Europe (RACE, ACТS projects) [6].},

Traditionally, Web service providers (WSPs) provide all customers with the same level of performance (best-effort service). Most service differentiation has been in the pricing structure (individual vs. business rates) or the connectivity type (dial-up access vs. leased line, etc.). This report presents DiffServer, a program that implements two simple, server-side, application-level mechanisms (server-centric and client-centric) to provide different levels of Web service. The results of the experiments show that there is not much overhead due to the addition of this additional layer of abstraction between the client and the Apache Web server under light load conditions. Also, the average waiting time for high priority requests decreases significantly after they are assigned priorities as compared to a FIFO approach.},

This paper furthers the study by proposing a suite of dynamical routing schemes. Dynamic allocation, advertisement and discovery of regeneration resources are proposed to support sharing transmitters and receivers between regeneration and access functions. This study follows the current trend in the optical networking industry by utilizing the extension of IP control protocols. Dynamic routing algorithms, aware of current regeneration resources and link states, are designed to smartly route the connection requests under quality constraints. A hierarchical network model, supported by the MPLS-based control plane, is also proposed to provide scalability. Experiments show that network performance is improved without placement of extra regenerators.},

Hence, much of the previous work in connection management has focused on the comparison of different algorithms in only distributed scheme or in only centralized scheme. However, we believe that the network blocking probability of these two connection management schemes depends, to a great extent, on the network traffic patterns and reservation times. Our simulation results reveal that the performance improvement (in terms of blocking probability) of the centralized method over the distributed method is inversely proportional to the ratio of average connection inter-arrival time to reservation time. After that the ratio increases beyond a threshold, those two connection management schemes yield almost the same blocking probability under the same network load. In this paper, we review the working procedure of distributed and centralized schemes, discuss the tradeoff between them, compare these two methods under different network traffic patterns via simulation and give our conclusion based on the simulation data.},

A primary reason for markets not adopting this technology is its failure to provide adequate security. Data that is sent over wireless links can be compromised with utmost ease. In this project, we propose a distributed agent based intrusion detection and response system for wireless LANs that can detect unauthorized wireless elements like access points, wireless clients that are in promiscuous mode etc. The system reacts to intrusions by either notifying the concerned personnel, in case of rogue access points and promiscuous nodes, or by blocking unauthorized users from accessing the network resources.},

	abstract = {The emergence of wavelength-division multiplexing (WDM) technology provides the capability for increasing the bandwidth of synchronous optical network (SONET) rings by grooming low-speed traffic streams onto different high-speed wavelength channels. Since the cost of SONET add-drop multiplexers (SADM) at each node dominates the total cost of these networks, how to assign the wavelength, groom the traffic, and bypass the traffic through the intermediate nodes has received a lot of attention from researchers recently. Moreover, the traffic pattern of the optical network changes from time to time. How to develop dynamic reconfiguration algorithms for traffic grooming is an important issue. In this paper, two cases (best fit and full fit) for handling reconfigurable SONET over WDM networks are proposed. For each approach, an integer linear programming model and heuristic algorithms (TS-1 and TS-2, based on the tabu search method) are given. The results demonstrate that the TS-1 algorithm can yield better solutions but has a greater running time than the greedy algorithm for the best fit case. For the full fit case, the tabu search heuristic yields competitive results compared with an earlier simulated annealing based method and it is more stable for the dynamic case.},

Active research on providing fault tolerance in WDM networks in recent times underscores its significance. In this study, a dynamic partitioning protection routing technique for routing a Fault Tolerant Path Set (FTPS) in a network is proposed. Wavelength assignment schemes to this FTPS with backup multiplexing technique for networks with no wavelength conversion and full wavelength conversion are discussed. Performance is measured in terms of blocking probability and time to recover the failed connections.

Traffic grooming is needed to resolve this mismatch in an efficient way. We study the dynamic traffic grooming problem in WDM mesh networks using the fixed-alternate routing (FAR) approach. Based on the FAR approach, we propose the fixed-order grooming (FOG) algorithm to support on-line provisioning of multi-granularity subwavelength connections. As traffic grooming involves two-layered routing, it is significantly different from the routing and wavelength assignment (RWA) problem in wavelength-routed WDM networks. We introduce the route selection problem (also called grooming node selection problem) and propose three grooming policies to address this problem. The three grooming policies are load sharing (LS), sequential grooming (SG) and minimum gap (MG). To address the wavelength and transceiver constraints, we propose another three grooming policies including least physical hop first (LPH), least virtual hop first (LVH) and least stringent resource first (LSR). Simulations are conducted to evaluate the performance of the FOG grooming algorithm and the grooming policies.},

All arriving control packets are first buffered in the queues and then scheduled using the bandwidth reservation algorithm, in which real-time control packets are considered first before non-real-time control packets in reserving bandwidth. Simulation results show that our proposed protocol is averagely 52.72\% better than a First Come First Served (FCFS) protocol in guaranteeing QoS of real-time traffic when the offered load ratio of real-time to non-real-time is set at 1: 9.},

	abstract = {The next-generation SONET metro network is evolving into a service-rich infrastructure. At the edge of such a network, multi-service provisioning platforms (MSPPs) provide efficient data mapping enabled by generic framing procedure (GFP) and virtual concatenation (VC). The core of the network tends to be a meshed architecture equipped with multi-service switches (MSSs), In the context of these emerging technologies, we propose a load-balancing spare capacity reallocation approach to improve network utilization in the next-generation SONET metro networks. Using our approach, carriers can postpone network upgrades, resulting in increased revenue with reduced capital expenditures (CAPEX). For the first time, we consider the spare capacity reallocation problem from a capacity upgrade and network planning perspective. Our approach can operate in the context of shared-path protection (with backup multiplexing) because it reallocates spare capacity without disrupting working services. Unlike previous spare capacity reallocation approaches which aim at minimizing total spare capacity, our load-balancing approach minimizes the network load vector (NLV), which is a novel metric that reflects the network load distribution. Because NLV takes into consideration both uniform and non-uniform link capacity distribution, our approach can benefit both uniform and non-uniform networks. We develop a greedy load-balancing spare capacity reallocation (GLB-SCR) heuristic algorithm to implement this approach. Our experimental results show that GLB-SCR outperforms a previously proposed algorithm (SSR) in terms of established connection capacity and total network capacity in both uniform and non-uniform networks.},

This paper furthers those studies by proposing a dynamic resource allocation and dynamic routing scheme to operate translucent networks. This scheme is realized through dynamically sharing regeneration resources, including transmitters,receivers, and electronic interfaces, between regeneration and access functions under a multidomain hierarchical translucent network model. An intradomain routing algorithm, which takes into consideration optical-layer constraints as well as dynamic allocation of regeneration resources, is developed to address the problem of translucent dynamic routing in a single routing domain. Network performance in terms of blocking probability, resource utilization, and running times under different resource allocation and routing schemes is measured through simulation experiments.},

	abstract = {Group key management (GKM) is the most important issue in secure group communication (SGC). The existing GKM protocols fall into three typical classes: centralized group key distribution (CGKD), decentralized group key management (DGKM), and distributed/contributory group key agreement (CGKA). Serious problems remains in these protocols, as they require existence of central trusted entities (such as group controller or subgroup controllers), relaying of messages (by subgroup controllers), or strict member synchronization (for multiple round stepwise key agreement), thus suffering from the single point of failure and attack, performance bottleneck, or misoperations in the situation of transmission delay or network failure. In this paper, we propose a new class of GKM protocols: distributed group key distribution (DGKD). The new DGKD protocol solves the above problems and surpasses the existing GKM protocols in terms of simplicity, efficiency, scalability, and robustness.},

	abstract = {This paper addresses the two-layer dynamic traffic grooming problem in wavelength-division-multiplexed (WDM) mesh optical networks subject to resource constraints and the generalized wavelength continuity (GWC) constraint. The GWC constraint is a relaxed wavelength continuity constraint which incorporates various kinds of wavelength conversion capabilities that exist in optical networks. As an improvement over the existing layered auxiliary graph (layered-AG) approach which represents each wavelength separately in the auxiliary graph, we introduce a largely simplified link bundled auxiliary graph (LBAG) model and propose the SAG-LB method to find paths and assign wavelengths for new lightpaths subject to the GWC constraint. We propose the constrained integrated grooming algorithm (CIGA) based on the LBAG model. A grooming policy influences the resource utilization by determining the weight function of the auxiliary graph. We propose the least resource path first (LR) grooming policy, which is an improvement over the existing grooming policies in the literature, by integrating the wavelength and transceiver metrics together. Simulation results show that the LBAG model achieves a comparable blocking performance with the layered-AG approach while using a significantly less amount of running time. We also present the worst case time complexity analysis of the CIGA grooming algorithm and evaluate the performance of the LR grooming policy by simulation.},

	abstract = {Traffic grooming is an essential functionality of WDM optical networks to provision multi-granularity subwave-length connections. Depending on the number of lightpaths allowed in a connection route, traffic grooming can be classified as single-hop traffic grooming (SH-TG) and multi-hop traffic grooming (MH-TG). MH-TG is more general and resource-efficient than SH-TG, because it allows connections from different source-destination pairs to share the bandwidth of a lightpath. In this paper, we propose a MH-TG algorithm, namely the fixed-order multi-hop (FOMH) grooming algorithm, based on the fixed-alternate routing approach. We introduce the grooming node selection (GNS) problem in MH-TG and propose three grooming policies, namely exhaustive sequential (ES), limited-hop sequential (LHS) and load sharing (LS) policies, to address the GNS problem. Given that the analysis of MH-TG is a relatively unexplored area, we propose an analytical model to evaluate the blocking performance of MH-TG using FOMH and the LS grooming policy. To address the multi-layered routing and multi-rate connection characteristics of traffic grooming, we introduce a novel multi-level decomposition approach in our analytical model which decomposes traffic at four different levels, namely alternate path, connection route, lightpath and link levels. The Erlang fixed-point approximation method is used to solve the analytical model. Numerical results show that analytical results matches well with simulation results. We also evaluate the effect of the grooming policies, the number of virtual hops (lightpaths) within a connection route and the number of alternate paths on the performance of the grooming algorithm.},

The proposed scheme aims to improve the re-keying cost for such applications. It uses a combination of an AVL tree and a binary search tree called the leaving tree as the topology of its key tree. Both the AVL tree and the leaving tree are searchable by members' departure times. Our analysis shows that the average costs in terms of the number of key updates for the member join and leave are O(logn) and O(loglog n), respectively.

This paper considers the problem of provisioning dynamic traffic using WBS in a WDM mesh network. The network of interest is a homogeneous WBS network, where each node has the functionality of WBS. The problem is called the dynamic WBS problem, which involves searching waveband-routes or wavelength-routes for the dynamically arriving traffic requests. The objective is to minimize the total switching and transmission costs in the optical domain. To solve the dynamic WBS problem, an auxiliary graph model capturing the network state is proposed. Based on the auxiliary graph, two heuristic on-line WBS algorithms with different waveband grouping policies are proposed, namely the wavelength-first WBS algorithm based on the auxiliary graph (WFAUG) and the waveband-first WBS algorithm based on the auxiliary graph (BFAUG). Simulation results indicate that WBS is an attractive technique which reduces the overall switching and transmission costs by up to 30\% in the network. The results also show that the WFAUG algorithm outperforms the BFAUG algorithm in terms of port savings and cost savings.},

A lot of research has been carried out in the areas of authentication and key management for such networks. However, due to lack of existing standards for such networks, most of the proposed schemes are based on different assumptions and are applicable only in specific environments. Recently Balachandran et al. proposed CRTDH [1], a novel key agreement scheme for group communications in wireless ad hoc networks. The protocol has many desirable properties such as efficient computation of group key and support for high dynamics. However, the protocol does not discuss mutual authentication among the nodes and hence, suffers from two kinds of attacks: man-in-the-middle attack and Least Common Multiple (LCM) attack. This paper identifies the problems with the current CRTDH scheme and discusses these attacks. AUTH-CRTDH, a modified key agreement protocol with authentication capability, is also presented. Results from extensive experiments that were run on the proposed protocol and some other key agreement protocols including CRTDH are also discussed. It can be observed from the experiments that the new scheme is comparable with the CRTDH scheme and better than many other non-authenticated schemes in terms of performance.},

In this study, we propose an approach to support dynamic lightpath scheduling in such networks. To minimize blocking probability in a network that accommodates dynamic scheduled lightpath demands (D- SLDs), resource allocation should be optimized in a dynamic manner. However, for the network users who desire deterministic services, resources must be reserved in advance and guaranteed for future use. These two objectives may be mutually incompatible. Therefore, we propose a two-phase dynamic lightpath scheduling approach to tackle this issue. The first phase is the deterministic lightpath scheduling phase. When a lightpath request arrives, the network control plane schedules a path with guaranteed resources so that the user can get a quick response with the deterministic lightpath schedule. The second phase is the lightpath re-optimization phase, in which the network control plane re-provisions some already scheduled lightpaths. Experimental results show that our proposed two-phase dynamic lightpath scheduling approach can greatly reduce WDM network blocking.},

The extended symmetric polynomial based dynamic conferencing scheme (ESPDCS) is one such KD scheme which has a high computational complexity that is universe size dependent. In this paper we present an enhancement to the ESPDCS scheme to develop a KD scheme called universe-independent SPDCS (UI-SPDCS) such that its complexity is independent of the universe size. However, the UI-SPDCS scheme does not scale with the conference size. We propose a relatively scalable KD scheme termed as DH-SPDCS that uses the UI-SPDCS scheme and the tree-based group Diffie-Hellman (TGDH) key exchange protocol.

Waveband switching technique has been proven to reduce the switch sizes considerably in large networks. Aggregation of wavelengths into wavebands and dis-aggregation of wavebands back to wavelengths can be done at end-nodes or intermediate-nodes. Most of the research on waveband switching has considered source-to-end switching. In intermediate waveband switching, aggregation and/or dis-aggregation can be done at an intermediate node. In the context of intermediate waveband switching, the problem of grooming wavelengths such that the number of ports saved is maximized is non-trivial. Recent research which considered intermediate waveband switching focused on routing and wavelength assignment problem such that the port saving is maximized. In this work we focus on the problem of intermediate waveband switching considering static traffic and assuming that routing and wavelength assignment is known. We define two intermediate waveband grooming polices, intermediate-to-destination waveband switching (ITD-WBS) and both-end-to-intermediate waveband switching (BETI-WBS), depending on where along the path aggregation/disaggregation of wavebands is done. We present greedy algorithms to compute wavebands for the two intermediate waveband grooming polices and analyze their computational complexities.},

In this work we study the problem of survivable virtual topology routing under single node/SRLG (Shared Risk Link Group) failure model. We prove that the survivable virtual topology routing problem under node/SRLG failures is NP-complete. We present an improved integer linear programming (ILP) formulation for computing the survivable routing of a virtual topology graph. However, ILP is not scalable when the network size scales more than a few tens of nodes. In this work, we present sub-classes of graphs which more accurately model an actual network and for which a survivable routing can be easily computed solving an ILP. We successfully computed the survivable routing of virtual topologies belonging to these sub-classes against link/SRLG failures for topologies of size up to 24 nodes.},

	abstract = {This paper considers the problem of dedicated path-protection in a wavelength-division multiplexing (WDM) mesh network with waveband switching (WBS) functionality under shared risk link group (SRLG) constraints. Two protection schemes are proposed, namely the Protecting-waveBand-At-waveBand-Level-only (PBABL) and the Mixed-Protection-At-waveBand-and-Wavelength-Level (MPABWL). The PBABL protects each working waveband-path by a backup waveband-path. While the MPABWL protects each working waveband-path by either a backup waveband-path or multiple backup lightpaths. The performances of the two protection schemes in terms of gained revenue and cost saving are studied and compared. Integer linear programming (ILP) formulations are presented to solve the problems for each protection scheme. Numerical results of the ILPs and the experimental results of previously proposed heuristics are presented, which show that both heuristics can obtain optimum solutions. According to the results, under heavy load traffic the MPABWL scheme provides solutions with higher revenues than the PBABL scheme does. Under light load traffic, where network resources are sufficient to accommodate all the traffics, the PBABL scheme leads to less switching and transmission costs than the MPABWL scheme does.},

	abstract = {The next-generation SONET metro network is evolving into a service-rich infrastructure. At the edge of such a network, multiservice provisioning platforms (MSPPs) provide efficient data mapping enabled by Generic Framing Procedure (GFP) and Virtual Concatenation (VC). The core of the network tends to be a meshed architecture equipped with Multi-service Switches (MSSs). In the context of these emerging technologies, we propose a load-balancing spare capacity reallocation approach to improve network utilization in the next-generation SONET metro networks. Using our approach, carriers can postpone network upgrades, resulting in increased revenue with reduced capital expenditures (CAPEX). For the first time, we consider the spare capacity reallocation problem from a capacity upgrade and network planning perspective. Our approach can operate in the context of shared-path protection (with backup multiplexing) because it reallocates spare capacity without disrupting working services. Unlike previous spare capacity reallocation approaches which aim at minimizing total spare capacity, our load-balancing approach minimizes the network load vector (NLV), which is a novel metric that reflects the network load distribution. Because NLV takes into consideration both uniform and non-uniform link capacity distribution, our approach can benefit both uniform and non-uniform networks. We develop a greedy load-balancing spare capacity reallocation (GLB-SCR) heuristic algorithm to implement this approach. Our experimental results show that GLB-SCR outperforms a previously proposed algorithm (SSR) in terms of established connection capacity and total network capacity in both uniform and non-uniform networks.},

This paper considers the peer selection problem in multi-view P2PMMS. This problem has been well studied in the traditional single-view P2PMMS; however, it becomes more complicated in multi-view P2PMMS, mainly due to the fact that a peer watching multiple channels joins multiple corresponding overlays. In this paper, we propose a novel peer selection algorithm, called Channel-Aware Peer Selection (CAPS), where a peer selects its neighboring peers based on the channel subscription of the system, in order to efficiently utilize the bandwidth of all peers in the system, especially those peers watching multiple channels. The results of a large-scale simulation with 10,000 peers and 4 channels shows that CAPS can significantly improve the system performance over the straightforward Random Peer Selection (RPS), which is widely used in single-view P2PMMS networks.},

Many key management protocols have been specifically designed for wireless sensor networks. However, most of the key management protocols focus on the establishment of the required keys or the removal of the compromised keys. The design of these key management protocols does not consider the support of higher level security applications. When the applications are integrated later in sensor networks, new mechanisms must be designed. In this paper, we propose a security framework, uKeying, for wireless sensor networks. This framework can be easily extended to support many security applications. It includes three components: a security mechanism to provide secrecy for communications in sensor networks, an efficient session key distribution scheme, and a centralized key revocation scheme. The proposed framework does not depend on a specific key distribution scheme and can be used to support many security applications, such as secure group communications. Our analysis shows that the framework is secure, efficient, and extensible. The simulation and results also reveal for the first time that a centralized key revocation scheme can also attain a high efficiency.},

In this paper, we propose a novel real-time communication scheme (RCS) to provide service-differentiated soft real-time guarantees for end-to-end communication in WSNs. We use hop-based geographic grouping to enable location awareness for sensor nodes with extremely low control overhead.We use dynamic forwarding with load-balanced receiver contention to provide a light-weight, yet efficient, routing technique, which can be easily adapted for duty cycle design. We use polling contention period based real-time MAC support to improve the service-differentiation granularity with better bandwidth utilization. The performance evaluation shows that our scheme can achieve low end-to-end latency, high on-time delivery ratio, fine services-differentiation granularity with load-balance for real-time traffic in unsynchronized low-cost WSNs.},

An important problem in P2P streaming systems is how to reduce their consumed bandwidth, which is a major concern of Internet service providers. Our work is motivated by the fact that a user may dynamically change the size of a window displaying a video stream according to his/her personal choice, a scenario we refer to as dynamic window resizing. In this paper, we propose a scheme called the partial forwarding scheme (PFS) based on layered coding, in which users with small windows help in forwarding a part of the enhancement layer. PFS significantly reduces the total consumed bandwidth while still maintaining the desired streaming quality. Our extensive simulation results show that PFS can reduce the total consumed bandwidth by up to 40\% while still maintaining satisfactory streaming quality.},

Trust establishment, key management, authentication, and authorization are important areas that need to be thoroughly researched before security in MANETs becomes a reality. This work studies the problem of secure group communications (SGCs) and key management over MANETs. It identifies the key features of any SGC scheme over such networks. AUTH-CRTDH, an efficient key agreement scheme with authentication capability for SGC over MANETs, is proposed. Compared to the existing schemes, the proposed scheme has many desirable features such as contributory and efficient computation of group key, uniform work load for all members, few rounds of rekeying, efficient support for user dynamics, key agreement without member serialization and defense against the Man-in-the-Middle attack, and the Least Common Multiple (LCM) attack. These properties make the proposed scheme well suited for MANETs. The implementation results show that the proposed scheme is computationally efficient and scales well to a large number of mobile users. Copyright © 2007 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.},

By observing that different users may watch a channel with different window sizes, we propose a cooperative scheme called partial participation scheme (PPS) in which different peers request a video stream at different rates based on their window sizes, and a subset of peers viewing the video stream using a small window work as helpers to forward extra data to help other peers using a large window. By reducing streaming rate received by small-window peers, the total amount of consumed bandwidth decreases without sacrificing users' satisfaction. PPS includes peer cooperative bandwidth allocation algorithms and neighbor maintenance mechanisms to achieve short resizing delay when a peer changes its window between different sizes. We evaluate the performance of PPS via a comprehensive set of metrics generated from extensive simulations.

In this paper, we propose a new protocol for multi-view P2P streaming, called divide-and-conquer (DAC), which efficiently solves the inter-channel bandwidth competition problem using a divide-and conquer strategy at the channel level, and thus is flexible to work with various streaming protocols. This makes DAC more suitable for upgrading current single-view P2P live streaming systems to multi-view P2P live streaming systems. Our extensive packetlevel simulations show that DAC is efficient in allocating the overall system bandwidth among competing channels, is flexible in working with various streaming protocols, and is scalable in supporting a large number of users and channels.},

	abstract = {The success of commercial Peer-to-Peer (P2P) video streaming systems has triggered interest in exploiting end users' bandwidth to reduce the operating costs of IPTV and Content Distribution Networks (CDN) and to improve the user-perceived service quality. Traditionally, users watching different channels are organized into separate overlays, where there is no cooperation among different channels. However, based on measurement studies, cross-channel cooperation is found to be desirable due to the bandwidth imbalance among different channels. In this paper, we focus on studying the characteristics of existing and potential designs to help system designers choose proper cross-channel cooperation strategies considering efficiency and implementation complexity. Specifically, we propose simple models based on network flow graphs for three general designs, namely Naive Bandwidth allocation Approach (NBA), Passive Channel-aware bandwidth allocation Approach (PCA) and Active Channel-aware bandwidth allocation Approach (ACA) respectively, which capture the key characteristics of different designs. We develop closed-form results for two-channel systems. Then, we use extensive numerical simulations to compare the three designs for various peer population distributions, upload bandwidth distributions and channel structures. Our analytical and simulation results show that: 1) Though the NBA design can be implemented with low complexity, it cannot efficiently use user's bandwidth in general cases; 2) the PCA design can achieve the same bandwidth utilization efficiency as the ACA design in general cases; and 3) the ACA design should be used for special applications and systems in which a user is restricted to watch only one channel at a time.},

However, the interdependencies between end-to-end communication cost and the anycasting design parameters have not been systematically studied. In this paper, a statistical end-to-end cost model is presented to capture the end-to-end latency and energy consumption of anycasting operation under a realistic wireless channel model. By exploring the relationship between the end-to-end cost efficiency and the forwarding decision dependent anycasting design parameters, two anycasting forwarding metrics are proposed for fully distributed forwarding decision. By exploring the relationship among the preamble length, the size of the forwarding set and the achievable end-to-end cost efficiency, a series of preamble length control guidelines are proposed for low and extremely low duty-cycled WSNs. According to our analytical results and simulation validation, the proposed forwarding metrics help reduce the end-to-end latency and energy consumption by about 55\% for anycasting with moderate preamble length, compared with the existing heuristic forwarding metrics. The proposed preamble length control guidelines help reduce, by more than half, the end-to-end energy and latency costs in low and extremely-low duty-cycled WSNs.},

A key management protocol includes two aspects: key distribution and key revocation. Key distribution has been extensively studied in the context of sensor networks. However, key revocation has received relatively little attention. In this paper, we first review and summarize the current key revocation schemes for sensor networks. Then, we present an efficient scheme, KeyRev, for removing compromised sensor nodes from a wireless sensor network (WSN). Unlike most proposed key revocation schemes focusing on removing the compromised keys on the sensor nodes, the KeyRev scheme uses key update techniques to obsolesce the keys owned by the compromised sensor nodes and thus remove the nodes from the network. We analyze the security of the KeyRev scheme and compare its performance against another centralized key revocation scheme and a distributed key revocation scheme. Our analyses show that the KeyRev scheme is secure in spite of not removing the pre-distributed key materials at compromised sensor nodes. Simulation results also indicate that the KeyRev scheme is scalable and performs very well compared with other key revocation schemes in WSNs. Copyright © 2008 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.},

The satellite communication technology is used at tier-one to provide reliable and low-cost long-haul connectivity between each local WSN and the central base station. By the end of 2009, the entire tier-one infrastructure has been designed and deployed to provide state-wide wireless connectivity for 54 monitoring sites equipped with 1-4 water level transducers. A data and network management framework has also been developed to enable the remote network retasking and network performance analysis from a central base station. The network web portal offers integrated real-time and historical groundwater data to worldwide users.

In this paper, we propose an approach based on Tabu Search heuristic for joint scheduling of computing, network and storage resources in a Lambda Grid network. The objectives are to minimize cost by efficient usage of resources and to minimize total completion time of job execution. The results are compared to a Greedy approach.

	abstract = {Many scientific and Grid applications require high-speed circuits of guaranteed bandwidth for scheduled transfers. Offline optimization of dynamic scheduled bandwidth demands is an efficient way of finding the near-optimal solution to the bandwidth scheduling problem. In this paper, we propose a continuous and parallel optimization method to address the dynamic and deterministic bandwidth scheduling problem in next generation wavelength-division multiplexing (WDM) networks. In this method a greedy algorithm and genetic algorithm are run in parallel in separate threads and both of them take the Dynamic Scheduled Bandwidth Demand (D-SBD) as their input. The user gets his response only from the greedy algorithm and hence he will get a deterministic answer in a short amount of time. The genetic algorithm takes as one of its inputs the output of the greedy algorithm and does the optimization of the D-SBDs with minimizing blocking probability as its fitness function. The greedy algorithm copies the optimized reservation database of the genetic algorithm at regular intervals. The user submitting a D-SBD request is unaware of the optimization done by the genetic algorithm. This method is evaluated using both trace-driven simulation of real network traffic from the DOE ESnet network and stochastic traffic in ESnet network topology and a 24 node network topology. We also compare our approach with an earlier proposed method called re-optimization at blocking. Adding the genetic algorithm improves the performance of the network (in terms of blocking probability) compared to using only the greedy approach or the re-optimization at blocking method.},

As users have various demand on video qualities, we can provide them with video streams at different resolutions without impairing their satisfaction. The adaptive streaming rate technique is a promising method. However, in providing adaptive streaming rate services, P2P live streaming design faces the following challenge: how to provide all users with uninterrupted video with their desired qualities in case that their demand dynamically changes? To shed more light on this problem, we first derive a model and formulate the problem as a resource demand vs supply problem. Then we present a framework to address the challenge via efficient bandwidth allocation and group cooperation. Through comprehensive simulations, we evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed framework, and conclude that it effectively helps existing solutions, such as Partial Participation Scheme (PPS), achieve better performance.},

	abstract = {To accommodate the increasing demands for bandwidth, Internet Service Providers (ISPs) have deployed higher-speed links and reconfigurable optical add drop multiplexers (ROADMs) in their backbone networks. To address the reliability challenges due to failures and planned outages, ISPs typically use two backbone routers at each central office in a dual-home configuration. Thus at the IP layer, redundant backbone routers as well as redundant transport equipment to interconnect them are deployed to provide reliability through node and path diversity. However, adding such redundant resources increases the overall cost of the network. Hence, a fundamental redesign of the backbone network which avoids such redundant resources by leveraging the capabilities of an intelligent optical transport network is a highly desirable objective. It is clear that such a redesign must lower costs without compromising on the reliability achieved by today's backbone networks. Modeling the costs and reliability of the network at all layers is an important step in achieving this objective. In this paper, we undertake an in-depth investigation of the cost and reliability considerations involved in designing the next-generation backbone network. Our work includes a detailed analysis of the operation, cost and reliability of the network at the IP layer and the multiple layers below it. We discuss alternative backbone network designs which use only a single router at each central office but use the optical transport layer to carry traffic to routers at other offices in order to survive failures or outages of the single local router. We discuss trade-offs involved in using these designs.},

The Internet is growing at a tremendous rate today. New services, such as telephony and multimedia, are being added to the pure data-delivery framework of yesterday. Such high demands on capacity could lead to a "bandwidth-crunch" at the core wide-area network resulting in degra dation of service quality. Fortunately, technological innovations have emerged which can provide relief to the end-user to overcome the In ternet's well-known delay and bandwidth limitations. At the physical layer, a major overhaul of existing networks has been envisaged from electronic media (such as twisted-pair and cable) to optical fibers - in the wide area, in the metropolitan area, and even in the local area set tings. In order to exploit the immense bandwidth potential of the optical fiber, interesting multiplexing techniques have been developed over the years. Wavelength division multiplexing (WDM) is such a promising tech nique in which multiple channels are operated along a single fiber si multaneously, each on a different wavelength. These channels can be independently modulated to accommodate dissimilar bit rates and data formats, if so desired. Thus, WDM carves up the huge bandwidth of an optical fiber into channels whose bandwidths (1-10 Gbps) are compati ble with peak electronic processing speed.},

As another contribution, we design a real-time deep learning technique to predict the network load distribution. We implemented a Long Short-Term Memory-based (LSTM) method with a sliding window technique to dynamically (at runtime) predict network load distributions at various lead times. Simulations were performed over three topologies: NSFNet, Cost266 and Eurolarge using real-world traffic traces to model the traffic patterns. Results show that our approach lowers the mean link load and total resources significantly while improving the resource utilization when compared to existing approaches. Additionally, our deep learning-based method showed promising results in load distribution prediction with low root mean squared error (RMSE) and ∼90\% accuracy.},

	abstract = {In optical networks, simulation is a cost-efficient and powerful way for network planning and design. It helps researchers and network designers quickly obtain preliminary results on their network performance and easily adjust the design. Unfortunately, most optical simulators are not open-source and there is currently a lack of optical network simulation tools that leverage machine learning techniques for network simulation. Compared to Wavelength Division Multiplexing (WDM) networks, Elastic Optical Networks (EON) use finer channel spacing, a more flexible way of using spectrum resources, thus increasing the network spectrum efficiency. Network resource allocation is a popular research topic in optical networks. In EON, this problem is classified as Routing, Modulation and Spectrum Allocation (RMSA) problem, which aims to allocate sufficient network resources by selecting the optimal modulation format to satisfy a call request. SimEON is an open-source simulation tool exclusively for EON, capable of simulating different EON setup configurations, designing RMSA and regenerator placement/assignment algorithms. It could also be extended with proper modelings to simulate CapEx, OpEx and energy consumption for the network. Deep learning (DL) is a subset of Machine Learning, which employs neural networks, large volumes of data and various algorithms to train a model to solve complex problems. In this paper, we extended the capabilities of SimEON by integrating the DeepRMSA algorithm into the existing simulator. We compared the performance of conventional RMSA and DeepRMSA algorithms and provided a convenient way for users to compare different algorithms’ performance and integrate other machine learning algorithms.},

Many research questions remain open and routing is one that is especially challenging. One manifestation of this heterogeneity is the diversity of spatio-temporal contacts established for communication between different network entities both inter- and intra-layer. In this paper, we expand the definition of heterogeneous wireless networks.

	abstract = {Named Data Networking (NDN) is a promising approach to provide fast in-network access to compact muon solenoid (CMS) datasets. It proposes a content-centric rather than a host-centric approach to data retrieval. Data packets with unique and immutable names are retrieved from a content store (CS) using Interest packets. The current NDN architecture relies on forwarding strategies that are only dependent upon on-path caching. Such a design does not take advantage of the cached content available on the adjacent off-path routers in the network, thus reducing data transfer efficiency. In this work, we propose a software-defined, storage-aware routing mechanism that leverages NDN router cache-states, software defined networking (SDN) and multipath forwarding strategies to improve the efficiency of very large data transfers. First, we propose a novel distributed multipath (D-MP) forwarding strategy and enhancements to the NDN Interest forwarding pipeline. In addition, we develop a centralized SDN-enabled control for the multipath forwarding strategy (S-MP), which leverages the global knowledge of NDN network states that distributes Interests efficiently. We perform extensive evaluations of our proposed methods on an at-scale wide area network (WAN) testbed spanning six geographically separated sites. Our proposed solutions easily outperform the existing NDN forwarding strategies. The D-MP strategy results in performance gains ranging between 10.4x to 12.5x over the default NDN implementation without in-network caching, and 12.2x to 18.4x with in-network caching enabled. For S-MP strategy, we demonstrate a performance improvement of 10.6x to 12.6x, and 12.9x to 18.5x, with in-network caching disabled and enabled, respectively. Further, we also present a comprehensive analysis of NDN cache management for large data transfers and propose a novel prefetching mechanism to improve data transfer performance. Due to the inherent capacity limitations of the NDN router caches, we use SDN to provide an intelligent and efficient solution for data distribution and routing across multiple NDN router caches. We demonstrate how software-defined control can be used to partition and distribute large CMS files based on NDN router cache-state knowledge. Further, SDN control will also configure the router forwarding strategy to retrieve CMS data from the network. Our proposed solution demonstrates that the CMS datasets can be retrieved 28\%–38\% faster from the NDN routers’ caches than existing NDN approaches. Lastly, we develop a prefetching mechanism to improve the transfer performance of files that are not available in the router’s cache.},

	abstract = {Resource allocation is a fundamental task in any PON and it is necessary to have an efficient scheme that reduces delay, maximizes bandwidth usage, and minimizes the resource wastage. A variety of dynamic bandwidth allocation (DBA) and dynamic wavelength and bandwidth allocation (DWBA) algorithms have been proposed which are based on different PONs (e.g., EPON, GPON, XG-PON, 10G EPON, etc.). But to our knowledge, no DWBA scheme for NG-PON2 system, with diverse customers and prioritized traffic, has been proposed yet. In this work, this problem is addressed and five different dynamic wavelength and bandwidth allocation (DWBA) schemes are proposed. First, mixed integer linear programming (MILP) models are developed to minimize the total delay of the high-priority data. Due to the MILP’s high computational complexity, heuristic algorithms are developed based on the MILP model insights. The five heuristic algorithms are: No Block-Split Heuristic (NBH), Equal Block-Split Heuristic (EBH), Priority-Based No Block-Split Heuristic (P-NBH), Priority-Based Equal Block-Split Heuristic (P-EBH), and Priority-Based Decider Block-Split Heuristic (P-DBH). Six priority classes of requests are introduced with the goal of minimizing the total delay for the high-priority data and to lessen the bandwidth wastage of the system. Finally, experiments for the performance evaluation of the five DWBA schemes are conducted. The results indicate that P-NBH, P-EBH, P-DBH schemes show a 47.63\% less delay and 30\% of less bandwidth wastage on average for the highest priority data transmission than the schemes without priority support (NBH and EBH). Among these five schemes, NBH method has the highest delay, whereas EBH and P-EBH waste more bandwidth than the other schemes. P-DBH is the most efficient among the five, because this scheme offers the lowest delay for high-priority data and the minimum bandwidth wastage for lower priority ones.},

	abstract = {Threat intelligence and management systems form a vital component of an organization's cybersecurity infrastructure. Threat intelligence, when used with active monitoring of network traffic, can be critical to ensure reliable data communication between endpoints. Threat intelligence systems are well suited for analyzing anomalous behaviors in network traffic and can be employed to assist organizations in identifying and successfully responding to cyber-attacks. In this paper, we present a machine learning approach for clustering malicious uniform resource locators (URLs). We focus on a URL dataset gathered from a threat intelligence feeds framework. We implement a k-means clustering solution for grouping malicious URLs obtained from open source threat intelligence feeds. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our unsupervised learning technique to discover the hidden structures in the malicious URL dataset. Our URL keyword/text clustering solution provides valuable insights about the malicious URLs and aids network operators in policy decisions to mitigate cyber-attacks. The clusters obtained using our approach has a silhouette coefficient of 0.383 for a dataset containing over 11,000 malicious URLs. Lastly, we develop a probabilistic scoring model to calculate the percentage of malicious keywords present in a given URL. After analyzing over 72,000 malicious keywords, our model successfully identifies over 80\% of the URLs in a test dataset as malicious.},

	abstract = {The Compact Muon Solenoid (CMS) on the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) manage high volumes of data that currently exceeds 100PB across different sites. An important challenge of delivering data to experimenters in the CMS workflow is the data volume. An experiment data file has an average size of 2 Gigabytes, with file sizes ranging between 100 Megabytes and 20 Gigabytes. Also, a complete dataset comprises of multiple files, with the dataset files ranging from 2 Terabytes and 100 Terabytes in size. Providing fast access to datasets is an important enabler for data-intensive science research. In our work, we demonstrate a Information-Centric Networking (ICN) approach to providing fast in-network access to CMS datasets. To that end, we must first address the problem of how to store large CMS files in network caches closer to the end-users. We propose a software-defined, storage-aware routing mechanism using named data networking (NDN) to achieve this goal. Due to the inherent capacity limitations of the NDN router caches, we use software defined networking (SDN) to provide an intelligent and efficient solution for data distribution and routing across multiple NDN router caches. We demonstrate how software-defined control can be used for partitioning and distributing large CMS files based on NDN router cache-state knowledge. Further, SDN control will also configure the router forwarding strategy to retrieve CMS data from the network. Using our proposed architecture, we show that CMS dataset can be retrieved 28\%–38\% faster from the NDN routers caches compared to existing approaches. Lastly, we develop a prefetching mechanism to improve the transfer performance of files not available in the router's cache.},

	abstract = {Software-Defined Networking (SDN) is a dynamic, and manageable network architecture which is more cost-effective than existing network architectures. The idea behind this architecture is to centralize intelligence from the network hardware and funnel this intelligence to the management system (controller) [2]-[4]. Since the centralized SDN controller controls the entire network and manages policies and the flow of the traffic throughout the network, it can be considered as the single point of failure [1]. It is important to find some ways to identify different types of attacks on the SDN controller [8]. Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attack is one of the most dangerous attacks on SDN controller. In this work, we implement DDoS attack on the Ryu controller in a tree network topology using Mininet emulator. Also, we use a machine learning method, Vector Machines (SVM) to detect DDoS attack. We propose to install flows in switches, and we consider time attack pattern of the DDoS attack for detection. Simulation results show the effects of DDoS attacks on the Ryu controller is reduced by 36\% using our detection method.},

	abstract = {Resource allocation is an important component of many Cloud computing and datacenter management problems. For infrastructure as a service(IaaS) in the Cloud, the Cloud service provider allocates computing resources such as processor, memory, and storage. In addition to the computing infrastructures, the Cloud service provider in the future would also allocate bandwidth for some applications that require guaranteed bandwidth service to transmit a large amount of data. This type of guaranteed bandwidth service can be provided by provisioning a distinct connection from end-to-end, e.g., by provisioning wavelength(s) in a wavelength division multiplexed wavelength routed network. In this paper, we focus on interdatacenter network-aware optimal resource allocation in the Cloud from the customer's perspective. We develop a mixed integer linear programming (MILP) optimal mathematical model and heuristics (Best-Fit and Tabu search) to solve the budget optimized joint-resource allocation problem to minimize the rental cost for each customer. The experimental results show that our heuristics can achieve an approximate optimal solution to the MILP solution and can reduce the customer's rental cost by at least 30\%. The Best-Fit heuristic with shortest job execution time first and simplest job structure first (SSF) scheduling policies have a better performance in terms of the traffic blocking rate. The traffic blocking rates under both scheduling policies are 5-25\% less than other policies. The Tabu search-based heuristic with SSF job scheduling policy has a better performance in terms of the traffic blocking rate than other job scheduling policies. In addition, the Tabu search-based heuristic also reduces the blocking rate by 4-30\% compared with the Best-Fit heuristic under any job scheduling policy.},

We leverage emerging deep learning techniques for time-series modeling to develop an application-aware predictive analytics system for accurately forecasting GridFTP connection loads. Our solution integrates with a major U.S. CMS Tier-2 site; we use a real dataset representing 670 million GridFTP transfer connections measured over 18 months to drive our predictive analytics solution. First, we perform extensive analysis on this dataset and use the connection loads as an example to study the temporal dependencies between various user-roles and workflow memberships. We use the analysis to motivate the design of a gated recurrent unit (GRU) based deep recurrent neural network (RNN) for modeling long-term temporal dependencies and predicting connection loads. We develop a novel application-aware, predictive and intelligent load balancer, APRIL, that effectively integrates application metadata and load forecast information to maximize server utilization. We conduct extensive experiments to evaluate the performance of our deep RNN predictive analytics system and compare it with other approaches such as ARIMA and multi-layer perceptron (MLP) predictors. The results show that our forecasting model, depending on the user-role, performs between 5.88\%-92.6\% better than the alternatives. We also demonstrate the effectiveness of APRIL by comparing it with the load balancing capabilities of an existing production Linux Virtual Server (LVS) cluster. Our approach improves server utilization, on an average, between 0.5 to 11 times, when compared with its LVS counterpart.},

	abstract = {Data transfer in wide-area networks has been long studied in different contexts, from data sharing among data centers to online access to scientific data. Many software tools and platforms have been developed to facilitate easy, reliable, fast, and secure data transfer over wide area networks, such as GridFTP, FDT, bbcp, mdtmFTP, and XDD. However, few studies have shown the full capabilities of existing data transfer tools from the perspective of whether such tools have fully adopted state-of-the-art techniques through meticulous comparative evaluations. In this paper, we evaluate the performance of the four highperformance data transfer tools (GridFTP, FDT, mdtmFTP, and XDD) in various environments. Our evaluation suggests that each tool has strengths and weaknesses. FDT and GridFTP perform consistently in diverse environments. XDD and mdtmFTP show improved performance in limited environments and datasets during our evaluation. Unlike other studies on data transfer tools, we also evaluate the predictability of the tools’ performance, an important factor for scheduling different stages of science workflows. Performance predictability also helps in (auto)tuning the configurable parameters of the data transfer tool. We apply statistical learning techniques such as linear/polynomial regression, and k-nearest neighbors (kNN), to assess the performance predictability of each tool using its control parameters. Our results show that we can achieve good prediction performance for GridFTP and mdtmFTP using linear regression and kNN, respectively.},

Designing intelligent solutions that respond to traffic changes automatically will soon become a mandatory requirement in production networks. In this paper, we focus on designing an intelligent control plane for the MobilityFirst Future Internet architecture. This architecture proposes novel mechanisms to replace the Internet Protocol to better support content delivery and mobility, such as hop-by-hop transfer, storage-aware routing and separation of identifiers and network addresses. In earlier work, we have argued that these mechanisms can be bypassed for certain data flows. Indeed, when there is no mobility involved, it is more convenient to implement cut-through switching at lower layers to bypass the routing mechanisms. In this paper, we propose an inter-domain framework capable of cut-through switching in MobilityFirst. The proposed framework is capable of adding and removing flows from tunnels automatically. It is also capable of creating inter-domain tunnels based on flow behavior and inter-domain latency. Our implementation experiments show that the control plane delay can be reduced by 75\% when using inter-domain tunnels. Furthermore, the results also show how our framework needs fewer messages than current protocols such as label distribution protocol to setup intra-domain and inter-domain tunnels.},

Orthogonal to this effort, we focus on a specific set of applications that cannot commit much storage space and computational resources, but require only reasonable guarantees on the validity of transactions. To this end, we introduce blockchain design alternatives, collectively called ApproxBC, that can provide proof of transactions with provable confidence bounds. Consequently, ApproxBC can considerably reduce the computation and storage resources required, making them suitable for resource-constrained Internet of Things environments. We also showcase two approximation-tolerant applications that can leverage the quicker computation and smaller storage requirements.},

User demand provisioning is an important issue for the cloud provider as the number of demands increases while the resources on the data center (DC) and the available bandwidth between DCs remain limited. The provisioning problem has serious implications in real-time scenarios, where the number of demands for the requested service is not known in advance. In this paper, we consider dynamic provisioning of the cloud resources including bandwidth scheduling for user demands where the requested DC resources (e.g. CPUs, storage and network ports) and bandwidth are not known in advance. We assume that the DCs are connected using IP/MPLS-over-WDM networks, which support grooming of the bandwidth from different demands where possible. Increasing the number of demands accepted while reducing the cost is important for providers. We propose and study the effects, of two greedy approaches to solve this problem, on the blocking probability and the total cost, which includes the operating expenditure (OpEx) and capital expenditure (CapEx).},

In this paper, we focus on the joint resource (processor, storage, and network) allocation in the grid/cloud environment. The multilayer optical network architecture is introduced to guarantee the reservation of the network bandwidth resource. We investigate the bandwidth guaranteed joint resource scheduling from the cloud provider\&\#x2019;s point of view, which is completing the resource scheduling with minimal capital expenditure. The mixed integer linear programming (MILP) formulations and heuristics (best-fit and tabu search) are developed to solve our problems. The results show that both MILP and heuristics work well to solve the problem, and the heuristics are much more time-efficient. In addition, the tabu search method achieves the optimal resource allocation and also reaches a lower blocking rate compared to the best-fit method.},

However, deploying such redundant resources increases the overall cost of the network. Hence, to avoid such redundant resources, a fundamental redesign of the backbone network leveraging the capabilities of an agile optical transport network is highly desired. In this paper, we propose a fundamental redesign of IP backbones. Our alternative design uses only a single router at each office. To survive failures or outages of a single local BR, we leverage the agile optical transport layer to carry traffic to remote BRs. Optimal mapping of local ARs to remote BRs is determined by solving an Integer Linear Program (ILP). We describe how our proposed design can be realized using current optical transport technology. We evaluate network designs for cost and performability, the latter being a metric combining performance and availability. We show significant reduction in cost for approximately the same level of reliability as current designs.},

Therefore how to improve the resource utilization in the Grid/Cloud to satisfy more task requests from users is becoming important. The objective of our investigation in this paper is to minimize the expense the consumers incur while obtaining the resources they request from Grid/Cloud networks. We propose a Tabu search based heuristic to solve joint resource allocation and task scheduling problem in Grid/Cloud networks, and examine the performance of the proposed method. The experimental results are analyzed and compared with the Best-Fit method we proposed in our earlier work. The results show that the Tabu search based heuristic method will equal or outperform the Best-Fit heuristic, and both can achieve approximate optimal solutions to the corresponding MILP (Mixed Integer Linear Programming) solutions. In addition, compared to the Best-Fit method, the Tabu search based heuristic will reduce the traffic blocking rate by 4\% 30\% generally under different job scheduling policies.},

	abstract = {Mobile devices are expected to become the Internet's predominant technology. Current protocols such as TCP/IP were not originally designed with mobility as a key consideration, and therefore underperform under challenging mobile and wireless conditions. MobilityFirst, a clean slate architecture proposal, embraces several key concepts centered around secure identifiers that inherently support mobility and trustworthiness as key requirements of the network architecture. This includes a hop-by-hop segmented data transport that allows late and dynamic rebinding of endpoint addresses to support mobility. While this provides critical gains in wireless segments, some overheads are incurred even in stable segments such as in the core. Bypassing layer 3 decisions in these cases, with lower layer cut through forwarding, can improve said gains. In this work, we introduce a general bypass capability within the MobilityFirst architecture that could provide both better performance and enable both individual and aggregate flow-level traffic control. Furthermore, we present a detailed OpenFlow-based design to bypass layer 3 routing in MobilityFirst, using layer 2 VLAN tagging. Finally, we present a prototype that shows that it is possible to use OpenFlow to create the bypass.},

Grid/Clouds users are provided with IT infrastructure (servers, storage, networks, etc.) as services called Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS). In this case, an efficient resource scheduling mechanism for allocating the infrastructure resources across the network will improve the resource efficiency in the cloud significantly. In this paper, we investigate the budget optimization of joint resources (storage, processor and network) allocation for IaaS model in distributed Grid/Clouds from the consumer's perspective. We develop a Mixed Integer Linear Programming (MILP) formulation along with a new resource model and propose a Best-Fit heuristic algorithm with different job scheduling policies. Our goal is to minimize the expenditure for each user to obtain enough resources to execute their submitted jobs, while enabling the Grid/Cloud provider to accept as many job requests from the users as possible. Both MILP and heuristic are tested on a 10- node topology and the Google Datacenter topology. The results show that the heuristic method can achieve approximate optimal solutions to MILP; it can reduce the user expense by at least 30\%. In addition, Best-Fit algorithm with SSF (simple job structure first) job scheduling policy has the lowest blocking rate, which is 5\% 25\% less than other job scheduling policies.},

	abstract = {A transparent (wide-area) wavelength-routed optical network may be constructed by using wavelength cross-connect switches connected together by fiber to form an arbitrary mesh structure. The network is accessed through electronic stations that are attached to some of these cross-connects. These wavelength cross-connect switches have the property that they may configure themselves into unspecified states. Each input port of a switch is always connected to some output port of the switch whether or not such a connection Is required for the purpose of information transfer. Due to the presence of these unspecified states, there exists the possibility of setting up unintended all-optical cycles in the network (viz., a loop with no terminating electronics in it). If such a cycle contains amplifiers [e.g., erbium-doped fiber amplifiers (EDFA's)], there exists the possibility that the net loop gain is greater than the net loop loss. The amplified spontaneous emission (ASE) noise from amplifiers can build up in such a feedback loop to saturate the amplifiers and result in oscillations of the ASE noise in the loop. Such all-optical cycles as defined above (and hereafter referred to as "white" cycles) must be eliminated from an optical network in order for the network to perform any useful operation. Furthermore, for the realistic case in which the wavelength cross-connects result in signal crosstalk, there is a possibility of having closed cycles with oscillating crosstalk signals. We examine algorithms that set up new transparent optical connections upon request while avoiding the creation of such cycles in the network. These algorithms attempt to find a route for a connection and then (in a post-processing fashion) configure switches such that white cycles that might get created would automatically get eliminated. In addition, our call-set-up algorithms can avoid the possibility of crosstalk cycles.},

	abstract = {Recently, there has been growing interest in developing optical fiber networks to support the increasing bandwidth demands of multimedia applications, such as video conferencing and World Wide Web browsing. One technique for accessing the huge bandwidth available in an optical fiber is wavelength-division multiplexing (WDM). Under WDM, the optical fiber bandwidth is divided into a number of nonoverlapping wavelength bands, each of which may be accessed at peak electronic rates by an end user. By utilizing WDM in optical networks, we can achieve link capacities on the order of 50 THz. The success of WDM networks depends heavily on the available optical device technology. This paper is intended as a tutorial on some of the optical device issues in WDM networks. It discusses the basic principles of optical transmission in fiber and reviews the current state of the art in optical device technology. It introduces some of the basic components in WDM networks, discusses various implementations of these components, and provides insights into their capabilities and limitations. Then, this paper demonstrates how various optical components can be incorporated into WDM optical networks for both local and wide-area applications.

	abstract = {In a wavelength-routed optical network, a transmitted signal remains in the optical domain over the entire route (lightpath) assigned to it between its source and destination nodes. The optical signal may have to traverse a number of crossconnect switches (XCS's), fiber segments, and optical amplifiers, e.g., erbium-doped fiber amplifiers (EDFA's). Thus, while propagating through the network, the signal may degrade in quality as it encounters crosstalk at the XCS's and also picks up amplified spontaneous emission (ASE) noise at the EDFA's. Since these impairments continue to degrade the signal quality as it progresses toward its destination, the received bit error rate (BER) at the destination node might become unacceptably high. Previous work on the lightpath routing and wavelength assignment (RWA) problem assumed an ideal physical layer and ignored these transmission impairments. The main contribution of our work is to incorporate the role of the physical layer in setting up lightpaths by employing appropriate models of multiwavelength optical devices (XCS's and EDFA's) such that the BER of a candidate lightpath can be computed, in advance, to determine if this lightpath should be used for the call. Features from existing RWA algorithms are integrated with our on-line BER calculation mechanism. Our simulation studies indicate that employing BER-based call-admission algorithms has a significant impact on the performance of realistic networks.},

The Internet, primarily based on packet switches, provides very flexible data services such as e-mail and access to the World Wide Web. The Internet is a variable-delay, variable- bandwidth network that provides no guarantee on quality of service (QoS) in its initial phase. New services are being added to the pure data delivery framework of yesterday. Such high demands on capacity could lead to a “bandwidth crunch” at the core wide-area network, resulting in degradation of service quality. Fortunately, technological innovations have emerged which can provide relief to the end user to overcome the Internet’s well-known delay and bandwidth limitations. At the physical layer, a major overhaul of existing networks has been envisaged from electronic media (e.g., twisted pair and cable) to optical fibers - in wide-area, metropolitan-area, and even local-area settings. In order to exploit the immense bandwidth potential of optical fiber, interesting multiplexing techniques have been developed over the years.},

The problem we address is how to specify, enforce, and implement access control in distributed environments. This problem occurs in many applications such as management of distributed project resources, e-newspaper and pay TV subscription services. Starting from an access relation between users and resources, we derive a user hierarchy, a resource hierarchy, and a unified hierarchy. The unified hierarchy is then used to specify the access relation in a way that is compact and that allows efficient queries. It is also used in cryptographic schemes that enforce the access relation. We introduce three specific cryptography based hierarchical schemes, which can effectively enforce and implement access control and are designed for distributed environments because they do not need the presence of a central authority (except perhaps for setup).},

Due to the high cost of an optical amplifier, it is desirable to strategically place the amplifiers throughout the network in a way that guarantees that all the signals are adequately amplified while minimizing the total number amplifiers being used. Previous studies all consider a star-based network. This paper demonstrates an original approach for solving the problem in switch-based WDM optical network assuming the traffic matrix is always the permutation of the nodes. First we formulate the problem by choosing typical permutations which can maximize the traffic load on individual links; then a GA (genetic algorithm) is used to search for feasible amplifier placements. Finally, by setting up all the lightpaths without violating the power constraints we confirm the feasibility of the solution.},

Depending on the number of all-optical segments on a single lightpath, three approaches can be used to operate such a network. These approaches are: transparency, opacity and translucency. Because physical-layer impairments and wavelength continuity impose a fundamental limitation on the reach distance of WDM signals, the transparency approach is not practical in the near future. On the other hand, the opacity approach needs regeneration for every wavelength at every intermediate node, thus resulting in prohibitive costs. Therefore, the translucency approach is a viable solution for operation of optical networks currently and in the near future.},

Optical packet switching requires a good switch architecture, which eliminates the O/E/O conversion as much as possible.

Different applications have different requirements, which necessitate employing differentiated services. This paper presents the idea of a priority-based /spl lambda/-scheduler, where the packets are differentiated into different classes and services are provided accordingly. For example, class 0 can correspond to non-real-time applications like email and ftp, while class 1 can correspond to real-time audio and video communications. The architecture is based on that of the /spl lambda/-scheduler and hence it has the added advantage of reduced component cost by using WDM internally.},

Future home and enterprise Internet users need high-bandwidth end-to-end connections that have to be provisioned automatically and dynamically. We need to make optical-layer routing as scalable and flexible as IP routing in today's Internet to support high-end applications. We study the problem of interdomain dynamic wavelength routing based on a multidomain translucent optical network model, which allows end-to-end lightpaths to be set up not only across multiple routing domains but also through two network layers: the optical layer and the regeneration layer. In this model, a lightpath can traverse the domain boundary either through optical bypass (OOO) or through optical-electrical-optical regeneration (OEO). We propose an interdomain dynamic wavelength-routing scheme with modest computational complexity to address the problem from an algorithmic perspective. Our experimental results show that the proposed interdomain dynamic wavelength-routing scheme can (a) flexibly incorporate various cost metrics and local (or intradomain) routing schemes into a uniform interdomain routing framework, (b) effectively set up end-to-end lightpaths in a multidomain translucent network, and (c) efficiently use both optical- and regeneration-layer resources.},

	abstract = {Survivable routing of a connection involves computation of a pair of diverse routes such that at most one route fails when failures occur in the network topology. A subset of links in the network that share the risk of failure at the same time are said to belong to a shared risk link group (SRLG) [J. Strand et al., Feb 2001]. A network with shared risk link groups defined over its links is an SRLG network. A failure of an SRLG is equivalent to the failure of all the links in the SRLG. For a connection to be survivable in an SRLG network, its working and protection paths must be routed on SRLG diverse paths. SRLG diverse routing problem has been proved to be NP-complete in J.Q. Hu (2003). According to the quality of service requirement of a survivable connection request, dedicated protection or shared protection can be used to establish the connection request. With dedicated protection, the connection is established on both the SRLG diverse working and protection paths. The simplest heuristic for computing SRLG diverse path pair is the two-step approach, but it suffers from the trap topology problem. In the previous study by Pin-Han Ho, an iterative heuristic (ITSH) using the two-step approach was proposed to compute the least cost SRLG diverse path pair. Suurballe's algorithm computes a pair of least cost link-disjoint paths between a node pair. In this work, we present a modified Suurballe's heuristic for computing the SRLG diverse routes between a node pair. We then propose an iterative heuristic (IMSH) which uses the modified Suurballe's heuristic for computing the least cost SRLG diverse routes. We also present an 1/2-cost-improvement optimality check criterion for dedicated protection},

Second, XML limits the objects sent to three types—data, documents, and messages. We introduce here an extensible content-based object router that goes beyond messages to routing entire Java objects. The Java Object Router (JOR) is an application-level router that allows Java objects to be routed according to their IP address, their label, their object type, or any of their content. In addition, JOR provides mechanisms to deal with varying routing policies. JOR separates routing mechanisms from routing policies, making it adaptable and easy to use in a variety of applications.

	abstract = {Sparse traffic grooming is a practical problem to be addressed in heterogeneous multi-vendor optical WDM networks where only some of the optical cross-connects (OXCs) have grooming capabilities. Such a network is called as a sparse grooming network. The sparse grooming problem under dynamic traffic in optical WDM mesh networks is a relatively unexplored problem. In this work, we propose the maximize-lightpath-sharing multi-hop (MLS-MH) grooming algorithm to support dynamic traffic grooming in sparse grooming networks. We also present an analytical model to evaluate the blocking performance of the MLS-MH algorithm. Simulation results show that MLS-MH outperforms an existing grooming algorithm, the shortest-path single-hop (SPSH) algorithm. The numerical results from analysis show that it matches closely with the simulation. The effect of the number of grooming nodes in the network on the blocking performance is also analyzed.},

	abstract = {Groundwater resources are the principal source of drinking water for about 50 percent of the United States population. Groundwater resources in Nebraska are under increasing stress as there is a rapid growth in their usage. Water managers need more timely and accurate data to assess ground-water conditions to manage adverse situations such as drought and loss of pumpage in agriculture and domestic water supply. Currently groundwater researchers use stand-alone data logging equipment which is labor intensive and the method is not easily scalable if the number of logging locations increases. Commercially available real-time data monitoring solutions are either prohibitively costly or highly inflexible. In this paper, we present a design for a groundwater monitoring system based on a network of wirelessly-linked pressure sensors. The proposed solution will enable groundwater researchers and decision makers to have quick access to the groundwater data with less effort and cost. Though our design is initially meant for groundwater monitoring, it can be easily adapted to other fields of environmental monitoring.},

We formulate the problem of computing optimal disjoint paths for providing shared protection in fully wavelength-convertible networks as the problem of computing least-cost disjoint paths with dependent cost structure (LDP-DCS). We prove that LDP-DCS is NP-complete and is also hard to approximate. We present an iterative modified network-flow heuristic for the problem.

The concept of dependent cost structure (DCS) of protection paths to enhance their resource sharing ability was proposed in our earlier work.

	abstract = {As wavelength-division multiplexing (WDM) evolves towards practical applications in optical transport networks, waveband switching (WBS) has been introduced to cut down the operational costs and to reduce the complexities and sizes of network components, eg, optical cross-connects (OXCs). This paper considers the routing, wavelength assignment and waveband assignment (RWWBA) problem in a WDM network supporting mixed waveband and wavelength switching. First, the techniques supporting waveband switching are studied, where a node architecture enabling mixed waveband and wavelength switching is proposed. Second, to solve the RWWBA problem with reduced switching costs and improved network throughput, the cost savings and call blocking probabilities along intermediate waveband-routes are analyzed. Our analysis reveals some important insights about the cost savings and call blocking probability in relation to the fiber capacity, the candidate path, and the traffic load. Third, based on our analysis, an online integrated intermediate WBS algorithm (IIWBS) is proposed. IIWBS determines the waveband switching route for a call along its candidate path according to the node connectivity, the link utilization, and the path length information. In addition, the IIWBS algorithm is adaptive to real network applications under dynamic traffic requests. Finally, our simulation results show that IIWBS outperforms a previous intermediate WBS algorithm and RWA algorithms in terms of network throughput and cost efficiency.},

However, upgrading the existing optical switching architecture requires time and money. Thus heterogeneous waveband switching (HeteroWBS) architecture would be desirable in such a system, where some nodes can support WBS functions and some cannot. We study the performance of HeteroWBS networks in terms of call blocking probability and cost savings under dynamically arriving traffic requests. We first investigate the effects of optical component developments on waveband switching in WDM networks. Various connection managements are then listed and analyzed. Next, to assist in the designing of efficient WBS algorithms, an autonomous clustering-based HeteroWBS (AS-HeteroWBS) architecture is proposed. The AS-HeteroWBS architecture clusters the network into multiple autonomous systems (ASs). An AS may contain some specific nodes that provide WBS functions for all the nodes in the AS. Based on the architecture, three HeteroWBS algorithms are proposed, namely, the autonomous heterogeneous WBS algorithm (AS-WBS), the autonomous source-limited heterogeneous WBS algorithm (AS-S-WBS), and the shortest-path-based heterogeneous WBS algorithm (SH-WBS). Our simulation results show that the HeteroWBS algorithms can achieve optimal cost savings while maintaining the same network throughput compared with the algorithm without WBS.},

	abstract = {Wireless sensor networks (WSNs) use sensors to monitor phenomena such as temperature, humidity, groundwater levels and transmit this information to a base station using wireless channels. WSNs find applications in military, ecological, and health-related areas. A hybrid wireless sensor network includes two networks: an ad hoc wireless network and a wireless sensor network. The nodes in the ad hoc network act as base stations conducting surveillance on the WSN. In this dissertation, we focus on the key management issues in hybrid wireless sensor networks. The key management issues in hybrid wireless sensor networks can be divided into three categories according to which layer they affect: ad hoc network layer, wireless sensor network layer, and integrated cross layer. At the ad hoc network layer, we propose two elliptic curve discrete logarithm problem (ECDLP) based schemes for secure group communication (SGC). Unlike the vast majority of secure group communication protocols using the discrete logarithm problem (DLP) based Diffie-Hellman as the basic key agreement protocol, our solutions use the ECDLP-based Diffie-Hellman protocol. We also extend our research on secure group communication to the wireless sensor network layer. We formally define the grouping and secure group communication problems in WSNs. We further propose and evaluate four centralized group rekeying (CGK) schemes for SGC in WSNs. Our proposed key management protocol at the integrated cross layer, mKeying, includes two schemes, a key distribution scheme, KeyDist, supporting multiple base stations in the network, and a centralized key revocation scheme, KeyRev, for removing compromised sensor nodes from the sensor network. Through these protocols for key distribution, key revocation, and group communication, we present an integrated approach to provide security in hybrid wireless sensor networks.},

Key distribution has been extensively studied in the context of sensor networks. However, key revocation has received relatively little attention. Existing key revocation schemes can be divided into two categories: centralized key revocation scheme and distributed key revocation scheme. In this paper, we first summarize the current key revocation schemes for sensor networks. Then, we propose an efficient centralized key revocation scheme, KeyRev, for wireless sensor networks. Unlike most proposed key revocation schemes focusing on removing the compromised keys, we propose to use key updating techniques to obsolesce the keys owned by the compromised sensor nodes and thus remove the nodes from the network. Our analyses show that the KeyRev scheme is secure inspite of not removing the pre-distributed key materials at compromised sensor nodes. Simulation results also indicate that the KeyRev scheme is scalable and performs very well in wireless sensor networks.},

By randomizing the rotation of cluster heads in each layer, the energy load is distributed evenly across sensors in the network. Our simulations show that LCH is effective in densely deployed sensor networks. On average, 70\% of live sensor nodes are involved directly in the clustering communication hierarchy. Moreover, the simulations also show that the energy load and dead nodes are distributed evenly over the network. As studies prove that the performance of LCH depends mainly on the distributed clustering protocol, the location of cluster heads and cluster size are two critical factors in the design of LCH.},

The objective of traffic grooming is to improve resource efficiency. However, resource contention between lightpaths and connections may result in inefficient resource usage or even the blocking of some connections. In this work, we employ a rerouting approach to alleviate resource inefficiency and improve the network throughput under a dynamic traffic model. We propose two rerouting schemes, rerouting at lightpath level (RRLP) and rerouting at connection level (RRCON) and a qualitative comparison is made between the two. We also propose two heuristic rerouting algorithms, namely the critical-wavelength-avoiding one-lightpath-limited (CWA-1L) rerouting algorithm and the critical-lightpath-avoiding one-connection-limited (CLA-1C) rerouting algorithm, which are based on the two rerouting schemes. Simulation results show that rerouting reduces the blocking probability of connections significantly.},

Parameters that are studied in the planning and optimization of a space program typically include the cost, schedule, risk and performance. The measure of success of a given space program architecture depends on the ability to meet certain predefined criteria with respect to these interdependent parameters. Large programs tend to be beset with cost overruns and schedule delays arising from technical risks. A notional model of integrated mission risk, taking into account the transient trends of hardware maturation is discussed. The total time taken to accomplish the first complete mission- from the start of the campaign to the safe return of crew to the Earth is considered as a metric. This model is used to investigate how risks associated with hardware, stemming from as yet unresolved or unrealized technical issues or defects in the design, impact the schedule risk. The mission end date distribution generated by this model and the sensitivity of the solution to different levels of initial maturity for the key hardware elements is discussed. Observations regarding strategic risk mitigation are provided on the basis of this analysis.},

This implies that recently proposed high-speed TCP variants are more likely to experience packet reordering than regular TCP in high-speed networks, since they are designed to achieve much higher throughput than regular TCP in these networks. In this paper, we first study the characteristics of packet reordering in high speed networks. Second, we verify the impact of packet reordering on high speed TCP variants and evaluate the effectiveness of the existing reordering-tolerant TCP enhancements using simulations. Our simulation results demonstrate that high-speed TCP variants perform poorly in the presence of packet reordering, and existing reordering-tolerant algorithms can significantly improve the performance of high-speed TCP variants.},

We study a class of admission control algorithms which statistically guarantee that a P2P live streaming system has sufficient overall bandwidth. Our results show that there is a tradeoff between the user blocking rate and user-behavior insensitivity (i.e., whether the system performance is insensitive to the fine statistics of user behaviors). We also find that the system performance is more sensitive to the distribution change of user inter-arrival times than to that of user lifetimes.},

A grid network that employs optical wavelength division multiplexing (WDM) technology and optical switches to interconnect computing resources with dynamically provisioned multigigabit rate bandwidth lightpath is called a lambda grid network. A computing task may be executed on any one of several computing nodes which possesses the necessary resources. In order to reflect the reality in job scheduling, allocation of network resources for data transfer should be taken into consideration. However, few scheduling methods consider the communication contention on lambda grids. In this paper, we investigate the joint scheduling problem while considering both optical network and computing resources in a lambda grid network. The objective of our work is to maximize the total number of jobs that can be scheduled in a lambda grid network. An adaptive routing algorithm is proposed and implemented for accomplishing the communication tasks for every job submitted in the network. Four heuristics (FIFO, ESTF, LJF, RS) are implemented for job scheduling of the computational tasks. Simulation results prove the feasibility and efficiency of the proposed solution.},

However, traditional end-to-end reliability enforcement is energy and time consuming for common loss-tolerant applications in WSNs. In this paper, a Loss-Tolerant Reliable Event Sensing protocol (LTRES) is proposed based on the particular reliability requirements for dynamic event observation in WSNs. According to the application-specific requirements, a reliable event sensing threshold at the transport layer is determined by the sink. A distributed source rate adaptation mechanism is designed, incorporating a loss rate based lightweight congestion control mechanism, to regulate the data traffic injected into the network so that the reliability requirements can be satisfied. An equation based fair rate control algorithm is designed to improve the fairness among the traffic flows sharing the congestion path. The performance evaluations show that LTRES can provide event-based loss-tolerant reliable data transport service for multiple events with short convergence time, low loss rate and high overall bandwidth utilization.},

In particular, we investigate what is the optimal segment size that obtains the best tradeoff between the time taken for recovery and minimizing the bandwidth used by the backup segments.

Measurement studies show that bandwidth resources of different channels are highly unbalanced and thus recent research studies have proposed various protocols to improve the streaming qualities for all channels by enabling cross-channel cooperation among multiple channels. However, there is no general framework for comparing existing and potential designs for multi-channel P2P systems. The goal of this paper is to establish tractable models for answering the fundamental question in multi-channel system designs: Under what circumstances, should a particular design be used to achieve the desired streaming quality with the lowest implementation complexity? To achieve this goal, we first classify existing and potential designs into three categories, namely Naive Bandwidth allocation Approach (NBA), Passive Channel-aware bandwidth allocation Approach (PCA) and Active Channel-aware bandwidth allocation Approach (ACA). Then, we define the bandwidth satisfaction ratio as a performance metric to develop linear programming models for the three designs. The proposed models are independent of implementations and can be efficiently solved due to the linear property, which provides a way of numerically exploring the design space of multi-channel systems and developing closed-form solutions for special systems.},

However, there is still a lack of theoretical analysis of how good we can achieve, and what guidelines we should follow when designing schemes in case of demand heterogeneity. To shed more light on demand heterogeneity problem, we model the problem as a resource demand and supply problem. We propose an optimization method to improve bandwidth efficiency through efficient bandwidth allocation. We develop a tiered overlay and a price-rated mechanism to implement cooperation among peers, and present a framework to address the challenge via efficient bandwidth allocation and group cooperation.

	abstract = {Digital video recorder (DVR) style and non-prerecording (NPR) style are two possible implementations for P2P-based time-shifted streaming, but existing P2P streaming solutions are not suitable to implement the NPR method. Since peers can view any arbitrary video segments which have been broadcasted, they might encounter severe video quality problems and the server bandwidth consumption can become high. In this paper, we focus on minimizing the server bandwidth consumption to maintain smooth streaming service in NPR-style P2P-based time-shifted streaming. To reduce the server cost, peers prefetch segments which are not required for their current viewing. Hence even if they are viewing different parts of the video, they can exchange segments with one another. However, segment prefetching competes for bandwidth with ordinary segment fetching, and it might bring negative impact. A good prefetching solution should not affect peers' viewing experience. We formulate the problem of finding a prefetching solution as an optimization problem, with the objective to minimize the server bandwidth consumption. Then we propose a heuristic algorithm by decomposing the global optimization problem into a set of smaller problems. Each peer runs this algorithm to determine which segments to prefetch and how to serve other peers. Simulation experiments demonstrate that our design provides P2P-based time-shifted streaming at low server bandwidth consumption.},

Many of them are combined together to form bundle links or composite links and the component links are referred to as sublinks. These physical sublinks could be SONET connections, Ethernet circuits, wavelengths on a fiber, etc. And they could be shut down or brought up independently. Selectively shutting down sublinks during low traffic periods could save a large amount of energy while keeping the network topology unchanged. Based on this concept, we propose a local heuristical threshold- based method to explore the potential energy- savings in the backbone network by adjusting the number of active sublinks in bundle links. An experiment based on an Internet2 derived synthetic network was conducted to verify the performance of our method and the results show that 86\% of energy consumed on ports of core routers could be saved when setting 90.0\% as the link utilization threshold. The experiment also shows that setting 90.0\% as threshold is safe enough to avoid data loss during extreme traffic increases in this case. Compared to previous proposed ILP (Integer linear programming) based global heuristic algorithms, our local heuristic algorithm can achieve energy-savings close to the optimum and greatly reduce the response time and the risk of data loss.},

Previous work on building multi-view P2P streaming systems requires network coding in data block scheduling within each channel, since it solves the fundamental inter-channel bandwidth competition problem at the individual peer level. Therefore, it limits the migration from existing single-view systems to multi-view systems. In this paper, we propose a new protocol, called divide-and-conquer (DAC), which provides a flexible way of building multi-view P2P streaming systems based on existing single-view systems. Specifically, the DAC protocol solves the inter-channel bandwidth competition problem at the channel level based on a divide-and-conquer strategy. Our extensive packet level simulations show that our DAC protocol achieves the three design goals: flexibility, efficiency and scalability.},

Inspired by the fact that different users in a P2P live streaming system may watch the same channel with different window sizes which have different resolution demands, we consider the design of a P2P live-video streaming system. The design utilizes this fact to reduce the bandwidth consumption but still achieve satisfactory streaming quality. We advocate adaptive streaming: a peer’s streaming rate is commensurate with its window size. In order to maintain satisfactory streaming quality even in the case when users dynamically change their window sizes, small-window users contribute part of their bandwidth to help large-window users. We propose the general design goals, and then model and formulate the design as an optimization problem. In order to design simple and efficient systems for dynamic window resizing, we study two schemes which represent two different design philosophies: a well-balanced and more distributed method and a supernode-based method. Specifically, a scheme called partial forwarding scheme (PFS) and another scheme called partial participation scheme (PPS). Our packet-level simulation results show that both PFS and PPS are easy to implement, and achieve good performance with appropriate parameter settings. Further, we also discuss their advantages and disadvantages, and demonstrate which scheme should be used in specific scenarios.},

To answer the first question, we propose simple models based on linear programming and network-flow graphs for three general designs, namely Naive Bandwidth allocation Approach (NBA), Passive Channel-aware bandwidth allocation Approach (PCA), and Active Channel-aware bandwidth allocation Approach (ACA), which provide insight into understanding the key characteristics of cross-channel resource sharing. For the second question, we first develop closed-form results for two-channel systems. Then, we use extensive numerical simulations to compare the three designs for various peer population distributions, upload bandwidth distributions, and channel structures. Our analytical and simulation results show that: 1) the NBA design can rarely achieve the desired streaming quality in general cases; 2) the PCA design can achieve the same performance as the ACA design in general cases; and 3) the ACA design should be used for special applications.},

	abstract = {It is challenging to provide delay-bounded service in a large-scale P2P live streaming system since a P2P streaming system is not scalable from the perspective of playback delay. However, certain peers called subscribers are more sensitive to playback delay than other peers, and the violation of the delay bound dramatically affects their satisfaction. In this paper, we study subscriber bounded delay (SBD) problem, which aims to provide bounded delay service to subscribers and best-effort delay service to ordinary peers in a large-scale single channel P2P live streaming system. We formulate the SBD as a decision problem and prove that it is NP-Complete. Then we propose a decentralized heuristic called the high fanout promotion (HFP) algorithm, which helps the system to serve the maximum number of subscribers with delay-bounded service, and to provide best-effort delay service to remaining subscribers and ordinary peers. We evaluate its performance using simulation experiments and compare our approach with the naive greedy algorithm and the general delay minimization approaches in the literature. Our extensive packet-level simulations show that our distributed solution can serve more subscribers with bounded delay video service compared to the other two methods (17\%-50\% in our simulations). Our distributed algorithm works well in both homogeneous and heterogeneous environments, and it converges very fast.},

	abstract = {The availability and reliability of optical backbone links are very important to ensure the efficient operation of the Internet. To address the issue of data loss due to optical link failures, there is a need for an optimal recovery strategy so that the traffic can be rerouted on a backup path to the destination. This paper builds on top of our prior research efforts (Yavary Mehr et al., 2022; Zhou et al., 2017) which introduced the concept of Resource Delayed Release (RDR) by adding a new state called ”idle state” which begins when the channel has completed carrying its services so that the next request can be carried immediately instead of waiting for a new channel to be established. While RDR improves the network performance by reducing the service provisioning time and blocking probability, it does not handle link failures which are quite common in optical networks. Therefore, enhancing RDR with protection strategies will make the network more reliable and thus we investigate this topic in this work. In this paper, we evaluate four different protection methods for single link failure recovery in WDM networks (Path Protection (PP), Partial Path Protection (PPP), Segment Protection (SegP) and Link Protection (LP)) with two different routing approaches namely Shortest Path (SPath) and Greedy (G) algorithm under uniform and non-uniform traffic generated using real traffic traces collected from a local Internet Service Provider (ISP). Special attention while evaluating these protection strategies was paid to the optimization of the amount of remaining bandwidth. The performance evaluation of the network under uniform and non-uniform traffic was done over the NSFNet and COST239 topologies by employing the metrics of link and network utilization, Blocking Probability (BP), Bandwidth Blocking Probability (BBP), Recovery Time (RT) and Service Provisioning Time (SPT). Our results show that the PPP method performs the best in terms of reducing BP, BBP, and SPT compared with PP, LP, and SegP in all three topologies while utilizing RDR.},

	abstract = {A centralized Software-defined Network (SDN) controller, due to its nature, faces many issues such as a single point of failure, computational complexity growth, different types of attacks, reliability challenges and scalability concerns. One of the most common fifth generation cyber-attacks is the Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attack. Having a single SDN controller can lead to a plethora of issues with respect to latency, computational complexity in the control plane, reachability, and scalability as the network scale increases. To address these issues, state-of-the-art approaches have investigated multiple SDN controllers in the network. The placement of these multiple controllers has drawn more attention in recent studies. In our previous work, we evaluated an Entropy-based technique and a machine learning-based Support Vector Machine (SVM) to detect DDoS using a single SDN controller. In this paper, we extend our previous work to further decrease the impact of the DDoS attacks on the SDN controller. Our new technique called Hierarchical Classic Controllers (HCC) uses SVM and Entropy methods to detect abnormal traffic which can lead to network failures caused by overwhelming a single controller. Determining the number of controllers and their best placement are major contributions in our new method. Our results show that the combination of the above three methods (HCC with SVM and Entropy), in the case of a network with 3 controllers provides greater accuracy and improves the DDoS attack detection rate to 86.12\% compared to 79.03\% and 81.33\% using Entropy-based HCC and SVM-based HCC, respectively.},

	abstract = {In today's wide area networks, especially in Optical Transport Networks (OTN) with Software Defined Networking (SDN) features enabled over Wavelength Division Multiplexing (WDM), Bandwidth on Demand (BoD) is an important service that can be satisfied by dynamic end-to-end service provisioning. Service provisioning time (SPT) and Blocking Probability (BP) are critical performance metrics for the users and carriers. This paper extends the concept of the Resource Delayed Release (RDR) strategy for WDM networks. The basic idea of this strategy is to introduce a delay in releasing the optical channel, when the channel is no longer carrying any services. This delay can help speed up the provisioning time for carrying the next service request, avoiding the time usually taken to establish a new optical channel. The main goals of the RDR method are to reduce SPT and BP while simultaneously satisfying the quality of service (QoS) constraints. In this paper, we investigate the effects of uniform and non-uniform traffic on the performance of RDR strategy. For non-uniform traffic simulation, we use a mesh topology with the 14 most populous cities in USA as of 2018 and model the non-uniform traffic based on population density. Further, we introduce a new metric called the Bandwidth Blocking Probability (BBP) to measure the quality of the service offered by the network. Simulation results show advantages of using the RDR method under a wide variety of traffic scenarios for both uniform and non-uniform traffic distributions compared to the traditional method. RDR reduces SPT by 45–90\% for uniform traffic and 41–75\% for non-uniform traffic. RDR reduces BP by 35–85\% for uniform traffic and 30–75\% for non-uniform traffic. Additionally, RDR lowers BBP by 31–73\% for uniform traffic and 29–68\% for non-uniform traffic.},

This interest has exacerbated in 2020 and became a vital need during the current global pandemic. However, providing end-users of various educational backgrounds access to radio devices from a heterogeneous set of vendors is challenging. This paper introduces OneLNK, a remotely accessible testbed consisting of radio devices from three different vendors and developed using open source cloud-native technologies. End-users can access the functionalities of OneLNK from a single webpage without any local installations. Using the web URL, users can operate radio devices, set experiment parameters, observe results in real-time, and save generated experiment data for all radio devices. The interactive web UI and its working mechanism for supporting radio equipment are covered with specific experiment capabilities. A diverse set of radio equipment (mmWave, sub-GHz SDR, and sub-6GHz SDR) are facilitated to explain these capabilities. Moreover, measurements of path loss, Received Signal Strength (RSS), and Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR) using devices from three different vendors operating on a vast spectrum (568 MHz, 5.8 GHz, and 60 GHz) are reported. The majority of the remotely accessible OneLNK platform was developed remotely during the pandemic by a team of experts from five U.S. states.},

We present a two-phase approach that combines an optimized multi-layer optical routing system with service mesh performance costs to improve end-to-end service performance. Our experimental strategy shows that leveraging a multi-layer architecture in combination with service performance information improves end-to-end performance.

	abstract = {Network availability is an important requirement in an optical telecommunication network. To overcome a disconnection, preparing a backup path before failure happens is required to reroute the affected traffic. This prevents any failure causing a significant amount of data loss or interruption in Wavelength Division Multiplexing (WDM) networks. Resource Delayed Release (RDR) is a new idea to improve the Service Provisioning Time (SPT) by adding the concept of idle optical channels. In earlier work [1] we proved that the delay in the removal of an idle optical channel helps the next service request to be carried immediately. In this paper, we address the problem of single link failure in WDM networks by comparing different protection methods when applied to the RDR strategy. We investigate and compare three algorithms that are mostly intended for maximization of the amount of remaining bandwidth over a damaged network. They are: Path Protection (PP), Link Protection (LP), and Partial Path Protection (PPP) [2]. The objective of this work is to apply the above protection methods on the RDR strategy to determine which method provides the best network performance in terms of Bandwidth Blocking Probability (BBP), Blocking Probability (BP), Service Provisioning Time (SPT), and recovery time (RT). Our simulation results show high network efficiency when using the RDR strategy with the PPP method for uniform traffic distribution. The highest BBP is when we do not apply any protection on RDR. When PPP is utilized there is a reduction of 58\% in BBP, of 64\% in BP, and of 40\% in SPT. Additionally RDR with PPP results in the lowest RT measured.},

The IPN is our only portal to the deep space, and yet it has been relatively sparse, until recently. With the ongoing and the planned missions to the outer space, the Delay Tolerant Networking (DTN) based network infrastructure will require more scalable routing and scheduling algorithms. In this paper, we propose the first Mixed Integer Linear Programming (MILP) model for message routing and scheduling in the IPN using Multi-Attribute Decision Making (MADM) principles. Based on this model, we propose a novel MADM-based algorithm called Multi-Attribute Routing and Scheduling (MARS) algorithm. This algorithm uses a sliding window of size n to schedule the first n messages in the buffer based on multiple attributes. After finding the optimal schedule for these messages (in terms of delivery rate), they are routed using our proposed Dijkstra-based routing algorithm. We use an existing MADM technique, PROMETHEE II, and consider the four main attributes of a message: size, priority, time to live (TTL), and time in buffer (TiB). Finally, we run multiple simulation experiments in order to test the performance of the proposed MARS and show that MADM coupled with scheduling and routing in IPN delivers at least three times more messages than a previously proposed technique, the Contact Graph Routing (CGR), while significantly reducing the average end-to-end delay and overhead.},

	abstract = {Globally, there is a significant rise in the number of connected devices. Every device has an access to wide variety of telecom services among which voice, video and best effort (BE) contribute significantly. There is a noticeable growing trend towards upstream BE traffic besides real time e-services that demand high quality of service (QoS). Converged next-generation fiber-wireless (FiWi) access networks composed of next-generation passive optical network (XG-PON) and 802.11n based wireless local area network (WLAN) has emerged as a suitable choice to provide high quality and affordable e-services to plenty of subscribers as they possess both high bandwidth and flexibility. In this paper, we study the performance of the integrated network architecture which combines XG-PON and enhanced distributed channel access (EDCA) under real time bursty traffic derived from the current global IP traffic distribution. The joint tuning of various crucial parameters of both XG-PON and EDCA with incorporation of an efficient deficit dynamic bandwidth algorithm (DBA) at optical line terminal (OLT) is done by exhaustive simulations in network simulator-3 (NS-3). Through intensive simulations and tuning, we are able to achieve a end-to-end delay performance of {\textbackslash}textless; 150 ms for voice, {\textbackslash}textless; 500 ms for video and a few seconds for BE upto full capacity. Also, a packet loss ratio (PLR) of {\textbackslash}textless; 3\% and {\textbackslash}textless; 6\% is achieved for voice and BE respectively upto full load. For voice PLR is {\textbackslash}textless; 1\% upto 60\% total offered load. Further, it is observed that the fine tuning of key parameters has also resulted in increased bandwidth for dominant BE services. Therefore, this optimized network architecture is 20\% more fair to BE services as compared to the conventional integrated FiWi architectures.},

	abstract = {Named Data Networking (NDN) is one of the promising future internet architectures, which focuses on the data rather than its location (IP/host-based system). NDN has several characteristics which facilitate addressing and routing the data: fail-over, in-network caching and load balancing. This makes it useful in areas such as managing scientific data across a distributed infrastructure. The Compact Muon Solenoid (CMS) experiment on the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) runs such an infrastructure and has a data access pattern amenable to Information-Centric Networking (ICN). In this paper, we propose SDTMA-NDN (Scientific Data Transfer Management Architecture using NDN) to distribute CMS’s software to worker-nodes and end-users. We provide several strategies to enhance the performance of NDN in transferring the scientific data. We build this on top of CERN Virtual Machine File System (CVMFS), a global, distributed filesystem designed to be used with cache-friendly workloads. CVMFS maintains its data by using content-addressable storage, which makes it suitable for NDN and a reasonable starting point for CMS. We examine the effect of in-network caching of NDN on the latency, how NDN provides transparent path selection to avoid high latency in the path, and how it balances several paths for retrieving the data. We compare SDTMA-NDN to the HTTP proxies used in the existing CVMFS-Content Distribution Network (CDN). Also, we propose two NDN forwarding strategies for retrieving the data; NDN Best-Path strategy (NDN-BP) and NDN Multi-path strategy (NDN-MP). SDTMA-NDN shows a better performance than the existing HTTP protocol in transferring the data. Further, it shows more resiliency and outperforms CVMFS-CDN under different network conditions.},

	abstract = {Named Data Networking (NDN) proposes a contentcentric rather than a host-centric approach to data retrieval. Data packets with unique and immutable names are retrieved from a content store (CS) using Interest packets. The current NDN architecture relies on forwarding strategies that are dependent upon on-path caching and is therefore inefficient. This approach reduces data transfer efficiency by ignoring the cached content available on the adjacent off-path routers in the network. In this paper, we propose a novel distributed multipath (D-MP) forwarding strategy and enhancements to the NDN Interest forwarding pipeline. Furthermore, we develop a centralized SDNenabled control for the multipath forwarding strategy (S-MP) that distributes Interests efficiently by using the global knowledge of the NDN network states. We perform extensive evaluations of our proposed methods on an at-scale WAN testbed spanning six geographically separated sites. Our solutions outperform the existing NDN forwarding strategies by a significant margin. We show that the D-MP strategy results in performance gains ranging between 10.4x to 12.5x over the default NDN implementation without in-network caching, and gains of 12.2x to 18.4x with in-network caching. In addition, for the S-MP case, we demonstrate a performance improvement of 10.6x to 12.6x, and 12.9x to 18.5x, for with- and without in-network caching respectively.},

Integrated fiber-wireless (FiWi) broadband access networks have emerged as a promising broadband access technology that can provide high quality e-services to large number of distributed wireless subscribers.

The performance evaluation of the integrated network is carried out in the NS-3 simulator and the results are reported in terms of delay and fairness index.

Network functions can be dynamically managed to provide the necessary services on-demand and further, services can be chained together to form a larger composite. In this paper, we address an important technical problem of mapping service function chains (SFCs) across different data centers with the objective of reducing the flow processing costs. We develop an integer linear programming (ILP) formulation to optimally map service function chains to multiple data centers while adhering to the data center's capacity constraints. We propose a novel application-aware flow reduction (AAFR) algorithm to simplify the SFC-ILP to significantly reduce the number of flows processed by the SFCs. We perform a thorough study of the SFC mapping problem for multiple data centers and evaluate the performance of our proposed approach with respect to three parameters: i) impact of number of SFCs and SFC length on flow processing cost, ii) capacitated/uncapacitated flow processing cost gains, and iii) balancing flow-to-SFC mappings across data centers. Our evaluations show that our proposed AAFR algorithm reduces flow-processing costs by 70\% for the capacitated-SFC mapping case over the SFC-ILP. In addition, our uncapacitated AAFR (AAFR-U) algorithm provides a further 4.1\% cost-gain over its capacitated counterpart (AAFR-C).},

The Interplanetary Network (IPN), hence, has to undergo many structural changes, as the traffic loads and types will drastically increase. In this paper, we propose N-Look Ahead Routing and Scheduling (N-LARS), a novel scheduling and routing technique for DTN-based IPNs with these new challenges. Our N-LARS model for Delay Tolerant Networking (DTN)-based IPNs provides scheduling of bundles (also called requests or messages) and efficient routing across the overall network. We develop a mixed integer linear programming (MILP) formulation for N-LARS problem and solve it using CPLEX. We further derive a heuristic that scales better than the MILP for large networks. We run experiments on networks mimicking the proposed Mars project by the European Space Agency. Finally, we compare the performance of the network using our scheduling model to its performance using the usual routing technique such as the Contact Graph Routing (CGR). Our simulation results show that the overall performance of the network using N-LARS for bundle scheduling and routing is four times better than CGR, in terms of delivered bundles, and 13.8\% closer to the sub- optimal schedule generated by the CPLEX solver.},

This network has very different communication conditions than the networks deployed on the surface of Earth. The large delays, intermittent connections and rough environment in space require the adoption of the Delay/Disruption Tolerant Network architecture/techniques. The currently used implementation of DTN interplanetary networks uses the Contact Graph Routing mechanism that we show, using the Interplanetary Overlay Network (ION) based experiments, has some shortcomings leading to less efficient use of the network. In this paper, we propose a novel model to represent such networks based on temporal graphs obtaining a near-real-time representation of these deterministic dynamic networks. This Modified Temporal Graph (MTG) model is then used for the implementation of our proposed routing algorithm, the Earliest Arrival Optimal Delivery Ratio (EAODR) routing algorithm. We provide the proof of correctness of EAODR, and we use our routing simulator to run experiments on a real-world network and also on large networks. We prove that EAODR outperforms the Contact Graph Routing (CGR) in terms of a decrease in delay of up to 12.9\%.},

Optical networking with advantages of high capacity and cost efficiency, would improve the network throughput for the cloud platform and improve the performance for serving big data applications. How to realize the network-aware resource provisioning for the big data applications in the optical DCN architecture would be an important issue that needs to be investigated. In this work, we focus on the network-aware resource provisioning in data center with different optical DCN architectures. Our target is to make use of limited computing and network resources in the data center to serve the maximum number of applications with minimal total cost. Optical networking is used to provide the guaranteed network bandwidth required by the applications. Mixed integer linear/quadratic programming (MILP/MIQP) optimization models are developed to solve the network-aware resource provisioning problem in the optical data center based on different types of DCN architectures.},

	abstract = {Cloud computing enables the provisioning of resources in a reliable and on-demand manner. With the increasing importance of the network bandwidth in the Cloud environment, the networking related resources need to be optimally allocated together with the traditional Cloud computing resources. In addition, the significant growth of the global data center traffic raises the challenge of supporting demands with large bandwidth requirements for the Cloud provider. In our paper, we consider the network-efficient virtualized cloud infrastructure provisioning problem in IP over elastic optical network (IP-over-EON) based on the data center as a service model. The elastic optical network is adopted to provide spectrum and cost-efficient networking resources for large bandwidth requests in our work. We develop mixed integer linear programming formulations to construct the mathematic model for this problem and propose a costoptimized heuristic to solve this problem. To investigate the cost and blocking rate for the served demands, different modulation formats are compared in the EON layer, and the sliceable bandwidth-variable transponders and optical traffic grooming technology are considered. The experimental results show that different modulation formats that are adopted in the EON layer will have different impacts on the total cost and demand blocking rate for the same data set size. Also the use of SBVT will reduce the total cost no matter which modulation format is adopted, and the reduction is related to the bandwidth requirement of the demands},

Manual configuration of multiple devices is being replaced by an automated approach where a software-based, network-aware controller handles the configuration of all network devices. Software applications running on top of the network controller provide an abstraction of the topology and facilitate the task of operating the network. We propose OpenSec, an OpenFlow-based security framework that allows a network security operator to create and implement security policies written in human-readable language. Using OpenSec, the user can describe a flow in terms of OpenFlow matching fields, define which security services must be applied to that flow (deep packet inspection, intrusion detection, spam detection, etc.) and specify security levels that define how OpenSec reacts if malicious traffic is detected. In this paper, we first provide a more detailed explanation of how OpenSec converts security policies into a series of OpenFlow messages needed to implement such a policy. Second, we describe how the framework automatically reacts to security alerts as specified by the policies. Third, we perform additional experiments on the GENI testbed to evaluate the scalability of the proposed framework using existing datasets of campus networks. Our results show that up to 95\% of attacks in an existing data set can be detected and 99\% of malicious source nodes can be blocked automatically. Furthermore, we show that our policy specification language is simpler while offering fast translation times compared to existing solutions.},

However, the problem of efficient data transfer across the network core has not been adequately investigated. We tackle the challenge of inter-domain cut-through switching using software-defined networking (SDN). First, we propose and solve an optimization problem that minimizes the total transfer time using inter-domain tunnels. Second, we propose an SDN-based routing framework for the MobilityFirst architecture capable of dynamically creating such tunnels. The main novelty of this framework is to name tunnels as network objects to simplify how tunnels are created and maintained. To validate our framework, we implement on the GENI (Global Environment for Network Innovations) testbed a prototype for the MobilityFirst architecture. Our experiments with the optimization problem show that the inter-domain latency between controllers plays a key role on how tunnels are setup. Furthermore, our implementation experiments show that the control plane delay can be reduced by 75\% when using inter-domain tunnels. Finally, we show how our framework needs fewer messages than current protocols such as label distribution protocol (LDP) to setup intra-domain and inter-domain tunnels.},

The model proposed in this paper is a heuristic that bases the capacity prediction for a future time slot on the number of 40G links needed in the current time slot. It also revolves around four parameters for which the values are empirically set. We set two thresholds, low and high, as well as the number of links to power off or power on each time the utilization is below or above a threshold. We assess our model through experiments featuring an Internet2-like topology and a real one-day worth of traffic split into five-minute time slots. The results offer a comparison between different parameters settings and how they affect energy savings and the number of overflows in the network that result from mis-prediction. That said, we demonstrate that our model can achieve up to 90\% reduction in energy consumption in the best case when the future traffic is known; otherwise, the savings can range between 82\% and 88\% with the occurrence of a small amount of traffic overflow events.},

	abstract = {The availability and reliability of optical backbone links are very important to ensure the efficient operation of the Internet. To address the issue of data loss due to optical link failures, there is a need for an optimal recovery strategy so that the traffic can be rerouted on a backup path to the destination. This paper builds on top of our prior research efforts (Yavary Mehr et al., 2022; Zhou et al., 2017) which introduced the concept of Resource Delayed Release (RDR) by adding a new state called ”idle state” which begins when the channel has completed carrying its services so that the next request can be carried immediately instead of waiting for a new channel to be established. While RDR improves the network performance by reducing the service provisioning time and blocking probability, it does not handle link failures which are quite common in optical networks. Therefore, enhancing RDR with protection strategies will make the network more reliable and thus we investigate this topic in this work. In this paper, we evaluate four different protection methods for single link failure recovery in WDM networks (Path Protection (PP), Partial Path Protection (PPP), Segment Protection (SegP) and Link Protection (LP)) with two different routing approaches namely Shortest Path (SPath) and Greedy (G) algorithm under uniform and non-uniform traffic generated using real traffic traces collected from a local Internet Service Provider (ISP). Special attention while evaluating these protection strategies was paid to the optimization of the amount of remaining bandwidth. The performance evaluation of the network under uniform and non-uniform traffic was done over the NSFNet and COST239 topologies by employing the metrics of link and network utilization, Blocking Probability (BP), Bandwidth Blocking Probability (BBP), Recovery Time (RT) and Service Provisioning Time (SPT). Our results show that the PPP method performs the best in terms of reducing BP, BBP, and SPT compared with PP, LP, and SegP in all three topologies while utilizing RDR.},

	abstract = {OpenFlow is currently the most commonly deployed Software Defined Networking (SDN) technology. SDN consists of decoupling the control and data planes of a network. A software-based controller is responsible for managing the forwarding information of one or more switches; the hardware only handles the forwarding of traffic according to the rules set by the controller. OpenFlow is an SDN technology proposed to standardize the way that a controller communicates with network devices in an SDN architecture. It was proposed to enable researchers to test new ideas in a production environment. OpenFlow provides a specification to migrate the control logic from a switch into the controller. It also defines a protocol for the communication between the controller and the switches. As discussed in this survey paper, OpenFlow-based architectures have specific capabilities that can be exploited by researchers to experiment with new ideas and test novel applications. These capabilities include software-based traffic analysis, centralized control, dynamic updating of forwarding rules and flow abstraction. OpenFlow-based applications have been proposed to ease the configuration of a network, to simplify network management and to add security features, to virtualize networks and data centers and to deploy mobile systems. These applications run on top of networking operating systems such as Nox, Beacon, Maestro, Floodlight, Trema or Node.Flow. Larger scale OpenFlow infrastructures have been deployed to allow the research community to run experiments and test their applications in more realistic scenarios. Also, studies have measured the performance of OpenFlow networks through modelling and experimentation. We describe the challenges facing the large scale deployment of OpenFlow-based networks and we discuss future research directions of this technology.},

	abstract = {To address the reliability challenges due to failures and planned outages, Internet Service Providers (ISPs) typically use two backbone routers at each central office to which access routers connected in a dual-homed configuration. At the IP layer, redundant backbone routers and redundant transport equipment to interconnect them are deployed, providing reliability through node and path diversity. However, adding such redundant resources increases the overall cost of the network. Hence, a fundamental redesign of the backbone network avoiding such redundant resources, by leveraging the capabilities of an agile optical transport network, is highly desired. In this paper, we propose such a fundamental redesign of IP backbones. Our alternative design uses only a single router at each office but uses the agile optical transport layer to carry traffic to remote Backbone Routers (BRs) in order to survive failures or outages of the single local BR. Optimal mapping of local Access Routers (ARs) to remote BRs is determined by solving an Integer Linear Program (ILP). We describe how our proposed design can be realized using current optical transport technology. We evaluate network designs for cost and performability, the latter being a metric combining performance and availability. We show significant reduction in cost for approximately the same level of reliability as current designs.},

This approach has been implemented in a production network planning tool.

To overcome the complexity of the problem, we divide it into two parts. First, we solve the pure RWA problem using fixed routes for every connection. Second, power assignment is accomplished by either using the smallest-gain first (SGF) heuristic or using a genetic algorithm. Numerical examples on a wide variety of networks show that: (a) the number of connections established without considering the signal attenuation was most of the time greater than that achievable considering attenuation; and (b) the genetic solution quality was much better than that of SGF, especially when the conflict graph of the connections generated by the linear solver is denser.},

The ability to switch a signal at intermediate nodes in a WDM network based on their wavelengths is known as wavelength-routing. One of the greatest advantages of using wavelength-routing WDM is the ability to create a virtual topology different from the physical topology of the underlying network. This virtual topology can be reconfigured when necessary, to improve performance. We discuss the previous work done on virtual topology design and also discuss and propose different reconfiguration algorithms applicable under different scenarios.},

However, service providers are still facing the challenges arising from the special requirements for provisioning services at the optical layer. In this paper, we incorporate some realistic constraints into the static provisioning problem, and formulate it under different network resource availability conditions. We consider three classes of shared risk link group (SRLG)-diverse path protection schemes: dedicated, shared, and unprotected. We associate with each connection request a lightpath length constraint and a revenue value. When the network resources are not sufficient to accommodate all the connection requests, the static provisioning problem is formulated as a revenue maximization problem, whose objective is maximizing the total revenue value. When the network has sufficient resources, the problem becomes a capacity minimization problem with the objective of minimizing the number of used wavelength-links. We give integer linear programming (ILP) formulations for these problems. Because solving these ILP problems is extremely time consuming, we propose a tabu search heuristic to solve these problems within a reasonable time. Experimental results are presented to compare the solutions obtained by an ILP solver, the tabu search heuristic and a divide-and-conquer greedy heuristic.},

Signaling is used to support connection setup, maintenance, and teardown in such a network. In this paper, we study the performance of two hop-by-hop and one parallel signaling schemes in wavelength-routed optical mesh networks. Based on the sequence between optical crossconnect (OXC) switching and signaling message processing, we classify hop-by-hop signaling into two types that comply with the requirements of GMPLS signaling protocols. These two types are forward before switching configuration (FBSC) and forward after switching configuration (FASC). Also, we propose a parallel signaling scheme that is different from the existing hop-by-hop GMPLS signaling protocols. Considering OXC architectures and traffic patterns, we compare the FBSC, FASC, and parallel signaling schemes using simulation experiments, in terms of network blocking probability and reservation time. The simulation data reveal that the performance of a signaling scheme depends on the nature of the signaling as well as the network setting (e.g., the OXC architecture and traffic pattern). We analyze reasons for this result and discuss tradeoffs between these signaling schemes.

In this paper, we study the STG problem in WDM mesh optical networks employing path protection at the connection level. Both dedicated protection and shared protection schemes are considered. Given the network resources, the objective of the STG problem is to maximize network throughput. To enable survivability under various kinds of single failures such as fiber cut and duct cut, we consider the general shared risk link group (SRLG) diverse routing constraints. We first resort to the integer linear programming (ILP) approach to obtain optimal solutions. To address its high computational complexity, we then propose three efficient heuristics, namely separated survivable grooming algorithm (SSGA), integrated survivable grooming algorithm (ISGA) and tabu search survivable grooming algorithm (TSGA). While SSGA and ISGA correspond to an overlay network model and a peer network model respectively, TSGA further improves the grooming results from SSGA and ISGA by incorporating the effective tabu search method. Numerical results show that the heuristics achieve comparable solutions to the ILP approach, which uses significantly longer running times than the heuristics.},

In this work we study the problem of survivable routing of a virtual topology on a physical topology with shared risk link groups (SRLG). The survivable virtual topology routing problem against single-link failures in the physical topology is proved to be NP-complete in E. Modiano and A. Narula-Tam, May 2002. We prove that survivable virtual topology routing problem against SRLG/node failures is also NP-complete. We present an improved integer linear programming (ILP) formulation (in comparison to E. Modiano and A. Narula-Tam, May 2002) for computing the survivable routing under SRLG/node failures. Using an ILP solver, we computed the survivable virtual topology routing against link and SRLG failures for small and medium sized networks efficiently. As even our improved ILP formulation becomes intractable for large networks, we present a congestion-based heuristic and a tabu search heuristic (which uses the congestion-based heuristic solution as the initial solution) for computing survivable routing of a virtual topology. Our experimental results show that tabu search heuristic coupled with the congestion based heuristic (used as initial solution) provides fast and near-optimal solutions.},

	abstract = {Secure group communication (SGC) with hierarchical access control (HAC) refers to a scenario in which a group of members is divided into a number of subgroups located at different privilege levels and a high-level subgroup can receive and decrypt messages within any of its descendant lower-level subgroups, while the reverse is not allowed. HAC is generally enforced using cryptography based techniques [Birget et al., 2001] ie, cryptographic keys play a primary role in the control of access rights. If the members of a higher level subgroup possess or can derive the key of a lower level subgroup, they have the right to access all messages within the lower level subgroup. In this chapter, we discuss several typical SGC schemes with HAC.},

	abstract = {This paper addresses the problem of survivable lightpath provisioning in wavelength-division-multiplexing (WDM) mesh networks, taking into consideration optical-layer protection and some realistic optical signal quality constraints. The investigated networks use sparsely placed optical-electrical-optical (O/E/O) modules for regeneration and wavelength conversion. Given a fixed network topology with a number of sparsely placed O/E/O modules and a set of connection requests, a pair of link-disjoint lightpaths is established for each connection. Due to physical impairments and wavelength continuity,both the working and protection lightpaths need to be regenerated at some intermediate nodes to overcome signal quality degradation and wavelength contention. In the present paper, resource-efficient provisioning solutions are achieved with the objective of maximizing resource sharing. The authors propose a resource-sharing scheme that supports three kinds of resource-sharing scenarios, including a conventional wavelength-link sharing scenario, which shares wavelength links between protection lightpaths, and two new scenarios, which share O/E/O modules between protection lightpaths and between working and protection lightpaths. An integer linear programming (ILP)-based solution approach is used to find optimal solutions. The authors also propose a local optimization heuristic approach and a tabu search heuristic approach to solve this problem for real-world,large mesh networks. Numerical results show that our solution approaches work well under a variety of network settings and achieves a high level of resource-sharing rates (over 60\% for O/E/O modules and over 30\% for wavelength links), which translate into great savings in network costs.},

First, an analytical model for ETE-WBS is proposed to determine the network blocking probability in a mesh network. For SD-IT-WBS, a simple waveband switching algorithm is presented. An analytical model to determine the network blocking probability is proposed for SD-IT-WBS based on the algorithm. The analytical results are validated by comparing with simulation results. Both results match well and show that ETE-WBS slightly outperforms SD-IT-WBS in terms of blocking probability.

In this paper, we study the static STG problem in WDM mesh networks employing path protection at the lightpath level. To make connections survivable under various failures such as fiber cut and duct cut, we consider the general shared risk link group (SRLG) diverse routing constraints. In addition to providing the results from the integer linear programming (ILP) approach, we propose three efficient heuristics, namely separated grooming algorithm (SGA), integrated grooming algorithm (IGA) and tabu search grooming algorithm (TSGA). While SGA and IGA correspond to an overlay model and a peer model respectively, TSGA further improves SGA and IGA by incorporating the tabu search method. Numerical results show that the heuristics use much shorter running times to generate network throughputs close to those of the ILP formulations.},

In this paper, we present a node model and a network model that perform sparse regeneration. We address the problem of translucent network design by proposing several regenerator placement algorithms based on different knowledge of future network traffic patterns.

	abstract = {Process engineering, process design and simulation, process supervision, control and estimation, process fault detection and diagnosis rely on the effective processing of unpredictable and imprecise information. A majority of applications require cooperation of two or more independently designed, separately located, but mutually affecting subsystems. In addition to good behavior of each of the subsystems, an effective coordination is very important to achieve the desired overall performance. Such a co-ordination can permit the use of commercially designed subsystems to perform more sophisticated tasks than at present and improve the operational reliability. However, such a co-ordination is very difficult to attain mainly due to the lack of precise system models and/or dynamic parameters. In such situations, the evolvable hardware (EHW) techniques, which can achieve the sophisticated level of information processing the brain is capable of, can excel. In this paper, a new multiple-sensor coordinator based sensor validation scheme combining the techniques of evolvable hardware and neural networks, is presented. The idea of this work is to develop a system that is resistant or tolerant to sensor failures (fault tolerance) by utilizing multiple sensor inputs connected to a programmable VLSI chip. The proposed system can be views as process modeling formalism and given the appropriate network topology; is capable of characterizing non linear functional relationships. The structure of the resulting evolvable hardware based process model can be considered generic, in the sense that little prior process knowledge is required. The knowledge about the plant dynamics and mapping characteristics are implicitly stored within the network. The proposed system help in extending the range of operation of the conventional control systems with respect to sensor validation at no extra (hardware) costs. The proposed design algorithms focus on using the characteristics that evolved systems present like, for example adaptation, auto-regulation and learning. The proposed sensor was tested for its effectiveness by introducing different sensor failures such as: sensor fails as open circuit, sensor fails as short circuit, multiple sensor failure etc. on a real time plant and in each case the performance index was computed and found to be acceptable.},

	abstract = {The static provisioning problem in wavelength-routed optical networks has been studied for many years. However, service providers are still facing the challenges arising from the special requirements for provisioning services at the optical layer. In this paper, we incorporate some realistic constraints into the static provisioning problem, and formulate it under different network resource availability conditions. We consider three classes of shared risk link group (SRLG)-diverse path protection schemes: dedicated, shared, and unprotected. We associate with each connection request a lightpath length constraint and a revenue value. When the network resources are not sufficient to accommodate all the connection requests, the static provisioning problem is formulated as a revenue maximization problem, whose objective is maximizing the total revenue value. When the network has sufficient resources, the problem becomes a capacity minimization problem with the objective of minimizing the number of used wavelength-links. We provide integer linear programming (ILP) formulations for these problems. Because solving these ILP problems is extremely time consuming, we propose a tabu search heuristic to solve these problems within a reasonable amount of time. We also develop a rerouting optimization heuristic, which is based on previous work. Experimental results are presented to compare the solutions obtained by the tabu search heuristic and the rerouting optimization heuristic. For both problems, the tabu search heuristic outperforms the rerouting optimization heuristic.},

The MPABWL scheme protects each working waveband-path by either a backup waveband-path or multiple backup lightpaths. Heuristic algorithms adopting random optimization technique are proposed for both the schemes. The performance of the two protection schemes is studied and compared.

This paper proposes the ECDLP-based Diffie-Hellman protocols for secure group communication and evaluates their performance on wireless ad hoc networks. The proposed schemes are compared at the same security level with DLP-based group protocols under different channel conditions. Our experiments and analysis show that the Tree-based Group Elliptic Curve Diffie-Hellman (TGECDH) protocol is the best in overall performance for secure group communication among the four schemes discussed in the paper. Low communication overhead, relatively low computation load and short packets are the main reasons for the good performance of the TGECDH protocol.},

The efficiency and user satisfaction highly depend on the constructed overlays. The common neighbor selection algorithms in existing overlay construction schemes usually randomly select a fixed number of neighbors which satisfy the selection requirements, such as end-to-end delay or a peerpsilas sojourn time. However, this fixed random neighbor-selection algorithm (FRNS) neglects the peerspsila upload bandwidth heterogeneity and therefore, the upload bandwidth cannot be efficiently used. In this paper, we propose a variable random neighbor-selection (VRNS) scheme to alleviate the problems due to bandwidth heterogeneity, and in which the number of neighbors with different upload bandwidths is dynamically determined by the statistical bandwidth information of the system. Our proposed scheme is shown to outperform FRNS based upon a large volume of carefully designed simulations.},

In addition, there exist extremely active uploaders and top 10\% active uploaders upload over 60\% videos. The video popularity demonstrates high skewness, where top 5\% the most popular videos contribute over 80\% views. Finally, we analyze the popularity evolution of hot-event videos using the consecutive 28-day video traces. The popularity of the studied videos decays very fast and most of these videos remain popular for only a week.

	abstract = {Real-time communication is crucial for wireless sensor networks (WSNs) to accomplish collaborative event sensing tasks with specific timing constraints. In this work, a service-differentiated real-time communication scheme (SDRCS) is developed to provide soft real-time guarantees for event-based traffic in WSNs. SDRCS features a cross-layer packet forwarding design to integrate the real-time routing functionality with a novel prioritized medium access control scheme. Based on this design, SDRCS performs distributed packet traversal speed estimation for traffic classification and admission control. SDRCS also performs prioritized packet forwarding so that the routing decisions are locally performed for maximized packet traversal speed. SDRCS requires no extra hardware for localization, transmission power adaptation or multi-channel transmission. It also adapts well to network dynamics, such as channel quality and communication voids. Performance evaluations show that SDRCS significantly improves the on-time delivery ratio and service-differentiation granularity for mixed priority traffic flows in unsynchronized WSNs, compared with currently used communication schemes. SDRCS also provides higher end-to-end throughput in terms of supporting higher source data rates with tight end-to-end latency requirements.},

	abstract = {As the complexity of deployments increases, network managers face two problems that we address in this paper. First, the deployment of middleboxes in choke points (between two routers through which all traffic flows), raises concerns regarding robustness, correctness and efficiency. Second, dynamically managing traffic isolation in a network is a very tedious task. In this paper we propose using Software Defined Networks (SDN) and OpenFlow to simplify network management by addressing these two challenges. SDN consists of decoupling the control and data planes of a network. OpenFlow standardizes the way that the controller communicates with the network devices in an SDN architecture. To overcome the challenge faced by deploying middleboxes in choke points, we show how these appliances can be deployed at waypoints. In this architecture, a waypoint is only traversed by traffic that needs further processing. The remaining data flows through the network without being processed by the middlebox. We have developed an application that implements an encryption processing unit that works as a waypoint and we show how OpenFlow can be used to route through the encryption unit only the traffic that requires encryption. To overcome the challenge of dynamic traffic isolation, we show how a network manager can use an application to create, delete and modify virtual local area networks (VLANs) in a dynamic way to achieve traffic isolation. Our implementation provides a GUI to the user so that the administration of the VLANs is greatly simplified.},

	abstract = {Increasingly, academic campus networks support large-scale data transfer workflows for data-intensive science. These data transfers rely on high-performance, scalable, and reliable protocols for moving large amounts of data over a high-bandwidth, high-latency network. GridFTP is a widely used protocol for wide area network (WAN) data movement. However, as the GridFTP protocol does not share connection information with the network-layer, network operators have reduced flexibility, particularly in identifying/managing flows across the network. We address this problem by deploying a production “ application-aware ” software defined network (SDN) for managing GridFTP transfers for data-intensive science workflows. We first propose a novel application-aware architecture called SNAG (SDN-managed Network Architecture for GridFTP transfers). SNAG combines application-layer and network-layer collaboration (termed “application-awareness”) with SDN-enabled network management to classify, monitor and to manage network resources actively. Until now, our SNAG deployment has successfully classified over 1.5 Billion GridFTP connections at the Holland Computing Center (HCC), University of Nebraska-Lincoln (UNL). Next, we develop an application-aware SDN system to provide differentiated network services for distributed computing workflows. At HCC, we also demonstrate how our system ensures the quality of service (QoS) for high-throughput workflows such as Compact Muon Solenoid (CMS) and Laser Interferometer Gravitational-Wave Observatory (LIGO). Further, we also demonstrate how application-aware SDN can be exploited to create policy-driven approaches to achieve accurate resource accounting for each workflow. We present strategies for implementing differentiated network services and discuss their capacity improvement benefits. Lastly, we provide some guidelines and recommendations for developing application-aware SDN architectures for general-purpose applications.},

This is achieved by using an optical route planning library called GNPy (Gaussian Noise model in python) as the calculation model within SIMON. SIMON is implemented in C++ and has mainly been used as an optical network learning tool for studying the performance of wavelength-routed optical networks. It measures the network blocking probability by taking into consideration the optical device characteristics. SIMON can capture the most significant impairments when estimating the Bit-Error Rate (BER) but does not consider fiber dispersion and non-linearities. These impairments can be significant when simulating a large-scale network. GNPy, on the other hand, considers those physical impairments and can give a more accurate signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) estimation validated by real-world measurements. By integrating GNPy with SIMON, we are able to set a minimum SNR threshold, which must be satisfied by any call set up in the network. The integration of SIMON and GNPy makes the resulting simulator not only suitable for academic learning but also valuable for real-world network planning, evaluation, and deployment of optical networks.},

	abstract = {A variety of DBA (Dynamic Bandwidth Allocation) and DWBA (Dynamic Wavelength and Bandwidth Allocation) algorithms have been proposed which are based on different PONs (e.g. EPON, GPON, XG-PON, 10G-EPON, etc.). But to our knowledge, no DWBA scheme for NG-PON2 system, with diverse customers and prioritized traffic, has been proposed yet. In this work, this problem is addressed and we focus on the wavelength assignment part, assuming that the system applies conventional DBA method described in the standard ITU-T G.989. Considering this assumption, we propose five different dynamic wavelength and bandwidth allocation (DWBA) schemes. First, mixed integer linear programming (MILP) models are developed to minimize the total delay of the high priority data. Due to the MILP’s high computational complexity, heuristic algorithms are developed based on the MILP model insights. The five heuristics algorithms are: No Block-Split Heuristic (NBH), Equal Block-Split Heuristic (EBH), Priority Based No Block-Split Heuristic (P-NBH), Priority Based Equal Block-Split Heuristic (P-EBH), and Priority Based Decider Block-Split Heuristic (P-DBH). Six priority classes of requests are introduced with the goal of minimizing the total delay for the high priority data and to lessen the bandwidth wastage of the system. Finally, experiments for the performance evaluation of the five DWBA schemes are conducted. The results show that P-DBH is the most efficient among the five because this scheme offers the lowest delay for high priority data and the minimum bandwidth wastage for lower priority ones.},

	abstract = {The Internet of Things (IoT) has opened large possibilities and more advanced applications, but it also increased the complexity of the network and its challenges. In this work, we are interested in statistically analyzing the predictability of connections in IoT networks in order to enhance their Quality of Service (QoS). Deep learning and classical prediction models are used to predict the dynamic spatio-temporal link availability, reduce overall path delay and improve the throughput. We are especially interested in mission-driven IoT networks (MD-IoT) such as the ones deployed in emergency and disaster relief missions, and vegetation and wildlife monitoring. In this paper, we propose a comprehensive Statistical Analysis (STAN) framework, that analyzes traces from MD-IoT networks and tests multiple deep learning and classical prediction models in order to identify the most appropriate one in terms of its applicability for the given network. We then implement a Dijkstra-based routing algorithm, PETRA, that integrates STAN's predictions. Finally, we run experiments using a dataset composed of real-life traces. We compare the performance of the two running modes of our PETRA routing algorithm to CRPO and show that PETRA can enhance the throughput by up to 29.4\%. The results also show that the overall network performance is enhanced by up to 36.7\%.},

	abstract = {The IT infrastructure of large organizations consists of devices and software services purchased from multiple vendors. The problem of measuring the quality of service (QoS) of each of these vendor devices (and services) is challenging since the vendors may tamper with the measurements for monetary benefits or saving debugging efforts. Existing solutions for QoS measurement in trusted environments cannot be extended for this problem since the vendors can easily circumvent them. Solutions borrowed from other areas such as client-server QoS measurement do not help either since they incur unreasonable storage and network overheads, or require extensive modifications to the packet headers. In this paper, we propose the Measuring Tape scheme, comprised of (1) a novel data structure called evidence Bloom filter (e-BF) that can be deployed at the vendor devices (and services), and (2) unique querying techniques, which can be used by the administrator to query the e-BF to measure QoS. While e-BF uses storage and computational resources judiciously, the querying techniques ensure resilience to adversarial behavior. We evaluate our solution based on a few real-world and synthetic traces and with different adversaries. Our results highlight the trade-off between resources (i.e., storage and computation) and the accuracy of QoS predictions, as well as its implications on security. We also present an analytical model of e-BF that establishes the relationship between storage, prediction accuracy, and security. Further, we present security arguments to illustrate how our solution thwarts adversarial attempts to tamper QoS.},

In our previous works, we have proposed and experimentally demonstrated a software-defined networking-based architecture (service-aware architecture) for converged control of packet and optical networks. In this paper, we first propose a concept called virtual transport link (VTL) to support dynamic link aggregation in software-defined IP over optical networks. Then, the VTL-based dynamic bandwidth adjustment (VTL-DBA) method is proposed for improving the resource utilization and for simplifying service provisioning. The feasibility of our proposals is experimentally verified on our software-defined IP over optical networks testbed. The performance of the VTL-DBA method is also evaluated based on our simulation platform in terms of resource usage, resource utilization, and blocking probability. For carrying quality guaranteed services, VTL-DBA saves 25\% of transport resources on average compared with static bandwidth allocation methods, and it shows an increase of 15\% in the average resource utilization. For carrying both quality guaranteed services and quality tolerant services, VTL-DBA reduces the service blocking probability to only 10\% on average with higher resource utilization than static bandwidth allocation methods.},

In this paper, we propose SDTMA-NDN (Scientific Data Transfer Management Architecture using NDN) to distribute CMS's software to worker-nodes and end-users. We build on top of CERN Virtual Machine File System (CVMFS), a global, distributed filesystem designed to be used with cache-friendly workloads. CVMFS maintain its data by using content-addressable storage, which makes it suitable for NDN and a reasonable starting point for CMS. We examine the effect of in-network caching of NDN on the latency, how NDN provides transparent path selection to avoid high latency in the path, and how it balances several paths for retrieving the data. We compare SDTMA-NDN to the HTTP proxies used in the existing CVMFS-Content distribution Network (CDN). We find that SDTMA-NDN is more resilient and outperforms CVMFS-CDN in the presence of network delays, while the CVMFS-CDN outperforms SDTMA-NDN in ideal cases where there is no delay.},

	abstract = {Software Defined Networking (SDN) is driving transformations in Research and Education (R\&E) networks, enabling innovations in network research, enhancing network performance, and providing security through a policydriven network management framework. The Holland Computing Center (HCC) at the University of Nebraska-Lincoln (UNL) supports scientists studying large datasets, and has identified a need for flexibility in network management and security, particularly with respect to identifying data flows. This problem is addressed through the deployment of a production SDN with a focus on integrating network resource management for large-scale GridFTP data transfers. We propose SNAG (SDN-managed Network Architecture for GridFTP transfers), an architecture that enables the SDN-based network management of GridFTP file transfers for large-scale science datasets. We also show how SNAG can efficiently and securely identify science dataset transfers from projects such as Compact Muon Solenoid (CMS) and Laser Interferometer Gravitational-Wave Observatory (LIGO). We focus on exposing an Application Program Interface (API) between the trusted GridFTP process and the network layer allowing the network to track flows via application metadata.},

	abstract = {Interplanetary Networks (IPN) are classified among challenged networks and hence are hard to model using static graphs. Furthermore, they do not behave optimally when operated using the standards and techniques of static networks. Delay Tolerant Networking (DTN) is one of the suggested solutions to overcome these networks' challenges. The more widely used implementation of DTN uses Contact Graph Routing (CGR) to find the path from source to destination. In this paper, we identify the shortcoming of CGR that results from overlooking the future contacts and propose the Earliest Arrival Optimal Delivery Ratio (EAODR) Routing that examines all the paths both with the desired earliest departure time and in the future in order to choose the earliest arrival path from a given node. EAODR finds the route that delivers the exchanged message (a.k.a. bundle) at most at the same time as CGR's route. We propose a Modified Temporal Graph (MTG) model that provides a near-real-time representation of the deterministic dynamic networks. We base EAODR routing algorithm on the MTG model. Our results show that we can reduce the delay by 12.9\% compared to CGR when we apply our algorithm to over 50 combinations of bundle sizes and transmission times.},

	abstract = {Interplanetary Internet or Interplanetary Networking is envisaged as a space network which interconnects spacecrafts, satellites, rovers and orbiters of different planets and comets for efficient exchange of scientific data such as telemetry and images. In this paper, we implement a layout of the Interplanetary Internet (IPN) with the Interplanetary Overlay Network (ION) software module that uses Contact Graph Routing (CGR). The experiments are then implemented on the Global Environment for Network Innovations (GENI) testbed. Along with realistic contact plans (CP) of the nodes, this network implementation was used to run experiments testing the performance of Delay Tolerant Networking (DTN) with and without cross links between Mars orbiters. The experiments showed that in an Earth-Mars communication network using two Mars orbiters, allowing cross links between the orbiters results in increasing the amount of data transferred by roughly 9.2\%. Data sent from Mars Rover to the Earth stations also increases by 35.7\% when a third satellite (Mars Express) was added to the network without cross links. Finally, when cross links are allowed across all satellites orbiting Mars and serving as relay nodes between the Earth stations and Mars rover, the communication was enhanced by almost 46\%. We conclude that by adding cross links, the performance of the network is enhanced for a better transmission of data from Mars to the Earth, which is very pertinent for the scalability of the network.},

	abstract = {Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs) are used in many applications in military, ecological, and health-related areas. These applications often include the monitoring of sensitive information such as enemy movement on the battlefield or the location of personnel in a building. Security is therefore important in WSNs. However, WSNs suffer from many constraints, including low computation capability, small memory, limited energy resources, susceptibility to physical capture, and the use of insecure wireless communication channels. These constraints make security in WSNs a challenge. In this article we present a survey of security issues in WSNs. First we outline the constraints, security requirements, and attacks with their corresponding countermeasures in WSNs. We then present a holistic view of security issues. These issues are classified into five categories: cryptography, key management, secure routing, secure data aggregation, and intrusion detection. Along the way we highlight the advantages and disadvantages of various WSN security protocols and further compare and evaluate these protocols based on each of these five categories. We also point out the open research issues in each subarea and conclude with possible future research directions on security in WSNs.},

	abstract = {Future space exploration demands a space network that will be able to connect spacecrafts with one another and in turn with Earth’s terrestrial Internet and hence efficiently transfer data back and forth. The feasibility of this technology would enable everyone to directly access telemetric data from distant planets and satellites. The concept of an Interplanetary Internet (IPN) is only in its incubation stage and considerable amount of common standards and research is required before widespread deployment can occur to make IPN feasible. Delay is an important factor in space communication and its nature is completely different from terrestrial delay environments. Moreover, space deployments and testing in space environments are very costly and time consuming. We propose a design of the IPN and implement it with the Interplanetary Overlay Network (ION) software module on physical nodes on the terrestrial ORBIT testbed. Two space network scenarios are designed and experimentally evaluated to verify the correctness of the network implementation. We also focus on the study of bundle transmission delay and separately evaluate the effect of bundle size and number of bundles. The experimental evaluation provides insights into the factors which caused delay in bundle transmission such as custody refusal, expiration of bundle lifetime and congestion.},

	abstract = {Elastic optical network is introduced as a promising technology to provide multi-bitrate-friendly data transmission in the optical layer. Elastic optical networks are based on flexible modulation format conversion, which can make more efficient use of spectrum resources than current fix-grid WDM networks. In this paper, we define the routing, modulation level and spectrum resource allocation (RMLSA) problem and then propose two novel dynamic modulation level conversion (MLC) enabled RMLSA algorithms. Numerical simulations are conducted to compare the performance of the path modulation level conversion (Path-MLC) and link modulation level conversion (Link-MLC) with different MLC thresholds with K-shortest paths RSA in terms of blocking rate, occupied spectrum and the number of MLCs across two topologies. The results verify that the Link-MLC with unlimited MLC achieves the lowest blocking rate and moderate spectrum utilization at the expense of intermediate node modulation conversions in two topologies. Smaller MLC threshold has higher blocking rate and occupied less spectrum resource. The results also suggest that the Path-MLC approach is more resource efficient than the Link-MLC with relatively higher blocking rate, and this method maybe more preferable in the networks with tight budget and/or energy constraints.},

	abstract = {Mobile devices are expected to become the Internet’s predominant technology. Current protocols such as TCP/IP were not originally designed with mobility as a key consideration, and therefore underperform under challenging mobile and wireless conditions. MobilityFirst, a clean slate architecture proposal, embraces several key concepts centered around secure identifiers that inherently support mobility and trustworthiness as key requirements of the network architecture. This includes a hop-by-hop segmented data transport based on a globally unique identifier. This allows late and dynamic rebinding of end-point addresses to support mobility. While this provides critical gains in wireless segments, some overheads are incurred even in stable segments such as in the core. Bypassing routing-layer decisions in these cases, with lower layer cut-through forwarding, can improve said gains. In this work, we introduce a general bypass capability within the MobilityFirst architecture that provides better performance and enables both individual and aggregate flow-level traffic control. Furthermore, we present an OpenFlow-based proof-of-concept implementation of the bypass function using layer 2 VLAN tagging. We run experiments on the ORBIT and Global Environment for Network Innovations (GENI) testbeds to evaluate the performance and scalability of the solution. By implementing the bypass functionality, we are able to significantly reduce the number of messages processed by the controller as well as the number of flow rules that need to be pushed into the switches.},
