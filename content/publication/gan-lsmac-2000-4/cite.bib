 abstract = {The rapid growth of the Internet is changing the way we do business. Electronic Commerce (or E-Commerce) is already a reality and will expand rapidly in the near future. However, the success of E-Commerce depends heavily on the scalability and availability of the servers. Cluster-based servers using commodity hardware have been accepted as a good alternative to expensive specialized hardware for building scalable services. In this paper, we summarize the two clustering architectures: IP-based clustering and MAC-based clustering. A new efficient implementation of the MAC-based clustering architecture is presented and its performance in clustering Web servers was measured using the WebStone benchmark and was found to be superior to that of existing MAC-based clustering implementations.},
