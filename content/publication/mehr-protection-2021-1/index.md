abstract: 'Network availability is an important requirement in an optical telecommunication
  network. To overcome a disconnection, preparing a backup path before failure happens
  is required to reroute the affected traffic. This prevents any failure causing a
  significant amount of data loss or interruption in Wavelength Division Multiplexing
  (WDM) networks. Resource Delayed Release (RDR) is a new idea to improve the Service
  Provisioning Time (SPT) by adding the concept of idle optical channels. In earlier
  work [1] we proved that the delay in the removal of an idle optical channel helps
  the next service request to be carried immediately. In this paper, we address the
  problem of single link failure in WDM networks by comparing different protection
  methods when applied to the RDR strategy. We investigate and compare three algorithms
  that are mostly intended for maximization of the amount of remaining bandwidth over
  a damaged network. They are: Path Protection (PP), Link Protection (LP), and Partial
  Path Protection (PPP) [2]. The objective of this work is to apply the above protection
  methods on the RDR strategy to determine which method provides the best network
  performance in terms of Bandwidth Blocking Probability (BBP), Blocking Probability
  (BP), Service Provisioning Time (SPT), and recovery time (RT). Our simulation results
  show high network efficiency when using the RDR strategy with the PPP method for
  uniform traffic distribution. The highest BBP is when we do not apply any protection
  on RDR. When PPP is utilized there is a reduction of 58% in BBP, of 64% in BP, and
  of 40% in SPT. Additionally RDR with PPP results in the lowest RT measured.'
