abstract: The exponential growth of the Internet, coupled with the increasing popularity
  of dynamically generated content on the World Wide Web, has created the need for
  more and faster Web servers capable of serving the over 100 million Internet users.
  Server clustering has emerged as a promising technique to build scalable Web servers.
  We examine the seminal work, early products, and a sample of contemporary commercial
  offerings in the field of transparent Web server clustering. We broadly classify
  transparent server clustering into three categories.
