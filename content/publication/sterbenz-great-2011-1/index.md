abstract: The Great Plains Environment for Network Innovation â€“ GpENI is an international
  programmable network testbed centered on a regional optical network in the Midwest
  US, providing flexible infrastructure across the entire protocol stack. The goal
  of GpENI is to build a collaborative research infrastructure enabling the community
  to conduct experiments in future Internet architecture. GpENI is funded in part
  by the US National Science Foundation GENI (Global Environments for Network Innovation)
  program and by the EU FIRE (Future Internet Research and Experimentation) Programme,
  and is affiliated with a project funded by the NSF FIND (Future Internet Design)
  Program.
