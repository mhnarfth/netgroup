abstract: Computer and telecommunication networks are changing the world dramatically
  and will continue to do so in the foreseeable future. The Internet, primarily based
  on packet switches, provides very flexible data services such as e-mail and access
  to the World Wide Web. The Internet is a variable-delay, variable- bandwidth network
  that provides no guarantee on quality of service (QoS) in its initial phase. New
  services are being added to the pure data delivery framework of yesterday. Such
  high demands on capacity could lead to a “bandwidth crunch” at the core wide-area
  network, resulting in degradation of service quality. Fortunately, technological
  innovations have emerged which can provide relief to the end user to overcome the
  Internet’s well-known delay and bandwidth limitations. At the physical layer, a
  major overhaul of existing networks has been envisaged from electronic media (e.g.,
  twisted pair and cable) to optical fibers - in wide-area, metropolitan-area, and
  even local-area settings. In order to exploit the immense bandwidth potential of
  optical fiber, interesting multiplexing techniques have been developed over the
  years.
