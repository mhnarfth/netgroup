abstract: Future space exploration demands a space network that will be able to connect
  spacecrafts with one another and in turn with Earthâ€™s terrestrial Internet and hence
  efficiently transfer data back and forth. The feasibility of this technology would
  enable everyone to directly access telemetric data from distant planets and satellites.
  The concept of an Interplanetary Internet (IPN) is only in its incubation stage
  and considerable amount of common standards and research is required before widespread
  deployment can occur to make IPN feasible. Delay is an important factor in space
  communication and its nature is completely different from terrestrial delay environments.
  Moreover, space deployments and testing in space environments are very costly and
  time consuming. We propose a design of the IPN and implement it with the Interplanetary
  Overlay Network (ION) software module on physical nodes on the terrestrial ORBIT
  testbed. Two space network scenarios are designed and experimentally evaluated to
  verify the correctness of the network implementation. We also focus on the study
  of bundle transmission delay and separately evaluate the effect of bundle size and
  number of bundles. The experimental evaluation provides insights into the factors
  which caused delay in bundle transmission such as custody refusal, expiration of
  bundle lifetime and congestion.
