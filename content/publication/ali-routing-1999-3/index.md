abstract: Routing and wavelength assignment (RWA) is an important problem that arises
  in wavelength division multiplexed (WDM) optical networks. Previous studies have
  solved many variations of this problem under the assumption of perfect conditions
  regarding the power of a signal. We investigate this problem while allowing for
  degradation of routed signals by components such as taps, multiplexers, and fiber
  links. We assume that optical amplifiers are preplaced. We investigate the problem
  of routing the maximum number of connections while maintaining proper power levels.
  The problem is formulated as a mixed-integer nonlinear program and two-phase hybrid
  solution approaches employing two different heuristics are developed.
