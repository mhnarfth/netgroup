abstract: The emergence of the Internet of Things (IoT), Internet of Everything (IoE),
  and now Tactile Internet (TI) among other new networking paradigms, has been enabled
  by the architectural changes of the Internet through 5G, 6G and beyond. New network
  architectures had to be heterogeneous in order to fulfill the tighter requirements
  for latency, reliability, adaptability, etc, the seamless support for a variety
  of devices, protocols and applications led to the creation of the multi-layered
  network architectures that include Non Terrestrial Networks (NTN). Many research
  questions remain open and routing is one that is especially challenging. One manifestation
  of this heterogeneity is the diversity of spatio-temporal contacts established for
  communication between different network entities both inter- and intra-layer. In
  this paper, we expand the definition of heterogeneous wireless networks. We then
  propose a novel and rigorous mathematical model for contact classification that
  captures several aspects of heterogeneity. Finally, we provide real-world application
  examples and map them to our proposed classification.
