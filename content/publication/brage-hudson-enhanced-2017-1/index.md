abstract: Single, low-income, African American mothers experience challenges caring
  for themselves and their infants. Nurse researchers, providing creative and theoretically
  based approaches for complex client health care, are increasingly becoming interdisciplinary
  leaders on research teams. The first purpose of this article was to describe this
  interdisciplinary teamâ€™s development of a cellular (cell) phone application (app),
  the Enhanced New Mothers Network (ENMN). The second purpose of this article was
  to describe lessons learned by nursing members of the interdisciplinary team members
  about developing a cell phone app for delivery of the ENMN intervention. Interdisciplinary
  research is beneficial where providing interventions to assist patients to achieve
  optimal health outcomes is rarely dependent on the work of one profession.
