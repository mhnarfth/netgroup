abstract: In this paper, we propose ERGO (edge architecture for Ag-IoT), an edge-computing
  architecture for infrastructureless smart agriculture environments. We also develop
  Ag-IoT application APIs and the associated microservice infrastructure. Our implementation
  and evaluations show that ERGO can operate independently of cloud-backed assistance,
  is highly scalable, modular, and affords composability benefits to Ag-IoT systems.
  We also demonstrate that ERGO outperforms traditional infrastructure in response
  latencies and transactional throughput, on average, by over 54% and 77%, respectively.
