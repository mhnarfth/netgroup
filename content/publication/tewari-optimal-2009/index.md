abstract: Protecting a network against link failures is a major challenge faced by
  network operators. The protection scheme has to address two important objectives
  - fast recovery and minimizing the amount of backup resources needed. Every protection
  algorithm is a tradeoff between these two objectives. In this paper, we study the
  problem of segment protection. In particular, we investigate what is the optimal
  segment size that obtains the best tradeoff between the time taken for recovery
  and minimizing the bandwidth used by the backup segments. We focus on the uniform
  fixed-length segment protection method, where each primary path is divided into
  fixed-length segments, with the exception of the last segment in the path. We observe
  that the optimal segment size for a given network depends on several factors such
  as the topology and the ratio of the costs involved.
