abstract: The emergence of wavelength-division multiplexing (WDM) technology provides
  the capability for increasing the bandwidth of synchronous optical network (SONET)
  rings by grooming low-speed traffic streams onto different high-speed wavelength
  channels. Since the cost of SONET add-drop multiplexers (SADM) at each node dominates
  the total cost of these networks, how to assign the wavelength, groom the traffic,
  and bypass the traffic through the intermediate nodes has received a lot of attention
  from researchers recently. Moreover, the traffic pattern of the optical network
  changes from time to time. How to develop dynamic reconfiguration algorithms for
  traffic grooming is an important issue. In this paper, two cases (best fit and full
  fit) for handling reconfigurable SONET over WDM networks are proposed. For each
  approach, an integer linear programming model and heuristic algorithms (TS-1 and
  TS-2, based on the tabu search method) are given. The results demonstrate that the
  TS-1 algorithm can yield better solutions but has a greater running time than the
  greedy algorithm for the best fit case. For the full fit case, the tabu search heuristic
  yields competitive results compared with an earlier simulated annealing based method
  and it is more stable for the dynamic case.
