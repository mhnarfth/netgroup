abstract: The Great Plains Environment for Network Innovation (GpENI) is an international
  programmable network testbed centered initially in the Midwest US with the goal
  to provide programmability across the entire protocol stack. In this paper, we present
  the overall GpENI framework and our implementation experience for the programmable
  routing environment and the dynamic circuit network (DCN). GpENI is built to provide
  a collaborative research infrastructure enabling the research community to conduct
  experiments in Future Internet architecture. We present illustrative examples of
  our experimentation in the GpENI platform.
