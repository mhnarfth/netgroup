abstract: Access control is a fundamental concern in any system that manages resources,
  e.g., operating systems, file systems, databases and communications systems. The
  problem we address is how to specify, enforce, and implement access control in distributed
  environments. This problem occurs in many applications such as management of distributed
  project resources, e-newspaper and pay TV subscription services. Starting from an
  access relation between users and resources, we derive a user hierarchy, a resource
  hierarchy, and a unified hierarchy. The unified hierarchy is then used to specify
  the access relation in a way that is compact and that allows efficient queries.
  It is also used in cryptographic schemes that enforce the access relation. We introduce
  three specific cryptography based hierarchical schemes, which can effectively enforce
  and implement access control and are designed for distributed environments because
  they do not need the presence of a central authority (except perhaps for setup).
