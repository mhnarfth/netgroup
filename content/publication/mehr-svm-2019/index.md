abstract: Software-Defined Networking (SDN) is a dynamic, and manageable network architecture
  which is more cost-effective than existing network architectures. The idea behind
  this architecture is to centralize intelligence from the network hardware and funnel
  this intelligence to the management system (controller) [2]-[4]. Since the centralized
  SDN controller controls the entire network and manages policies and the flow of
  the traffic throughout the network, it can be considered as the single point of
  failure [1]. It is important to find some ways to identify different types of attacks
  on the SDN controller [8]. Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attack is one of
  the most dangerous attacks on SDN controller. In this work, we implement DDoS attack
  on the Ryu controller in a tree network topology using Mininet emulator. Also, we
  use a machine learning method, Vector Machines (SVM) to detect DDoS attack. We propose
  to install flows in switches, and we consider time attack pattern of the DDoS attack
  for detection. Simulation results show the effects of DDoS attacks on the Ryu controller
  is reduced by 36% using our detection method.
