abstract: 'Most of the commercial P2P video streaming deployments support hundreds
  of channels and are referred to as multichannel systems. Measurement studies show
  that bandwidth resources of different channels are highly unbalanced and thus recent
  research studies have proposed various protocols to improve the streaming qualities
  for all channels by enabling cross-channel cooperation among multiple channels.
  However, there is no general framework for comparing existing and potential designs
  for multi-channel P2P systems. The goal of this paper is to establish tractable
  models for answering the fundamental question in multi-channel system designs: Under
  what circumstances, should a particular design be used to achieve the desired streaming
  quality with the lowest implementation complexity? To achieve this goal, we first
  classify existing and potential designs into three categories, namely Naive Bandwidth
  allocation Approach (NBA), Passive Channel-aware bandwidth allocation Approach (PCA)
  and Active Channel-aware bandwidth allocation Approach (ACA). Then, we define the
  bandwidth satisfaction ratio as a performance metric to develop linear programming
  models for the three designs. The proposed models are independent of implementations
  and can be efficiently solved due to the linear property, which provides a way of
  numerically exploring the design space of multi-channel systems and developing closed-form
  solutions for special systems.'
