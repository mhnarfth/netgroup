This project, titled "Intelligent Optical Networks Using Virtualization and Software-Defined Control," aims to redefine the capabilities of Internet Service Providers (ISPs) by implementing innovative solutions in software-defined networking (SDN) and virtualization.

The primary objective of this research is to develop a unified architecture for Software-Defined Optical Networks (SDON) that facilitates seamless end-to-end provisioning of services across heterogeneous, multi-domain networks.

This prestigious NSF award underscores the project's potential to contribute significantly to the field of networking technology and reflects the Foundation's commitment to advancing research with substantial intellectual merit and broader impacts.
