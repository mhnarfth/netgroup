abstract: To address reliability challenges due to failures and planned outages, Internet
  Service Providers (ISPs) typically use two backbone routers (BRs) at each central
  office. Access routers (ARs) are connected to these BRs in a dual-homed configuration.
  To provide reliability through node and path diversity, redundant backbone routers
  and redundant transport equipment to interconnect them are deployed. However, deploying
  such redundant resources increases the overall cost of the network. Hence, to avoid
  such redundant resources, a fundamental redesign of the backbone network leveraging
  the capabilities of an agile optical transport network is highly desired. In this
  paper, we propose a fundamental redesign of IP backbones. Our alternative design
  uses only a single router at each office. To survive failures or outages of a single
  local BR, we leverage the agile optical transport layer to carry traffic to remote
  BRs. Optimal mapping of local ARs to remote BRs is determined by solving an Integer
  Linear Program (ILP). We describe how our proposed design can be realized using
  current optical transport technology. We evaluate network designs for cost and performability,
  the latter being a metric combining performance and availability. We show significant
  reduction in cost for approximately the same level of reliability as current designs.
