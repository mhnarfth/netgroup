abstract: The next-generation SONET metro network is evolving into a service-rich
  infrastructure. At the edge of such a network, multiservice provisioning platforms
  (MSPPs) provide efficient data mapping enabled by Generic Framing Procedure (GFP)
  and Virtual Concatenation (VC). The core of the network tends to be a meshed architecture
  equipped with Multi-service Switches (MSSs). In the context of these emerging technologies,
  we propose a load-balancing spare capacity reallocation approach to improve network
  utilization in the next-generation SONET metro networks. Using our approach, carriers
  can postpone network upgrades, resulting in increased revenue with reduced capital
  expenditures (CAPEX). For the first time, we consider the spare capacity reallocation
  problem from a capacity upgrade and network planning perspective. Our approach can
  operate in the context of shared-path protection (with backup multiplexing) because
  it reallocates spare capacity without disrupting working services. Unlike previous
  spare capacity reallocation approaches which aim at minimizing total spare capacity,
  our load-balancing approach minimizes the network load vector (NLV), which is a
  novel metric that reflects the network load distribution. Because NLV takes into
  consideration both uniform and non-uniform link capacity distribution, our approach
  can benefit both uniform and non-uniform networks. We develop a greedy load-balancing
  spare capacity reallocation (GLB-SCR) heuristic algorithm to implement this approach.
  Our experimental results show that GLB-SCR outperforms a previously proposed algorithm
  (SSR) in terms of established connection capacity and total network capacity in
  both uniform and non-uniform networks.
