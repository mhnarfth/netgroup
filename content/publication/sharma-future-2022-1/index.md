abstract: In computer networking, simulations are widely used to test and analyse
  new protocols and ideas. Currently, there are a number of open real testbeds available
  to test the new protocols. In the EU, for example, there are Fed4Fire testbeds,
  while in the US, there are POWDER and COSMOS testbeds. Several other countries,
  including Japan, Brazil, India, and China, have also developed next-generation testbeds.
  Compared to simulations, these testbeds offer a more realistic way to test protocols
  and prototypes. In this paper, we examine some available wireless testbeds from
  the EU and the US, which are part of an open-call EU project under the NGIAtlantic
  H2020 initiative to conduct Software-Defined Networking (SDN) experiments on intelligent
  Internet of Things (IoT) networks. Furthermore, the paper presents benchmarking
  results and failure recovery results from each of the considered testbeds using
  a variety of wireless network topologies. The paper compares the testbeds based
  on throughput, latency, jitter, resources available, and failure recovery time,
  by sending different types of traffic. The results demonstrate the feasibility of
  performing wireless experiments on different testbeds in the US and the EU. Further,
  issues faced during experimentation on EU and US testbeds are also reported.
