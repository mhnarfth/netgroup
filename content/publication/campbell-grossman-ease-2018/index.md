abstract: The purpose of the study was to pilot test the Enhanced New Mothers Network
  smartphone app obtaining feedback on the ENMN app’s ease of use (clarity of functions
  and ease of navigation) and acceptability (participants’ level of acceptability
  and suggestions for improvement). A convenience sample of six adolescent, low-income
  mothers was recruited from two maternal health clinics in metropolitan communities
  in the USA and through snowballing. Investigators used written questionnaires with
  Likert items and open-ended questions for additional details from participants at
  two visits, a week apart. During and after the demonstration of the ENMN app, participants
  were asked verbal questions on the improvement of the ENMN app, and an investigator
  documented participants’ responses to questions, comments, and observations on field
  notes. Participants rated the ease of use (clarity of functions and ease of navigations)
  of the ENMN app as relatively high. Mothers expressed satisfaction in learning the
  ENMN app quickly and easily. Mothers’ responses were mixed regarding the acceptability
  of the ENMN app. Two mothers appreciated the visual results of creating their own
  username and avatar for the ENMN app. In contrast, some mothers reported the ENMN
  app should be made more visually interesting before the app is used in future studies.
