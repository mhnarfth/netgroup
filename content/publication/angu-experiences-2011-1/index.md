abstract: In this paper we share our experiences of enabling dynamic circuit creation
  in the GpENI network. GpENI is a network research testbed in the mid-west USA involving
  several educational institutions. University of Nebraska-Lincoln is involved in
  provisioning dynamic circuits across the GpENI network among its participating universities.
  We discuss several options investigated for deploying dynamic circuits over the
  GpENI network as well as our demonstration experiments at the GENI engineering conferences.
  UNL has also collaborated with ProtoGENI project of University of Utah and Mid-Atlantic
  Crossroads (MAX) facility of Washington DC to create inter-domain dynamic circuits.
