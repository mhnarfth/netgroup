abstract: Wireless sensor networks are promising solutions for many applications.
  However, wireless sensor nodes suffer from many constraints such as low computation
  capability, small memory, limited energy resources, and so on. Grouping is an important
  technique to localize computation and reduce communication overhead in wireless
  sensor networks. In this paper, we use grouping to refer to the process of combining
  a set of sensor nodes with similar properties. We propose two centralized group
  rekeying (CGK) schemes for secure group communication in sensor networks. The lifetime
  of a group is divided into three phases, i.e., group formation, group maintenance,
  and group dissolution. We demonstrate how to set up the group and establish the
  group key in each phase. Our analysis shows that the proposed two schemes are computationally
  efficient and secure.
