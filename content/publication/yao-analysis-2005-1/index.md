abstract: Traffic grooming is an essential functionality of WDM optical networks to
  provision multi-granularity subwave-length connections. Depending on the number
  of lightpaths allowed in a connection route, traffic grooming can be classified
  as single-hop traffic grooming (SH-TG) and multi-hop traffic grooming (MH-TG). MH-TG
  is more general and resource-efficient than SH-TG, because it allows connections
  from different source-destination pairs to share the bandwidth of a lightpath. In
  this paper, we propose a MH-TG algorithm, namely the fixed-order multi-hop (FOMH)
  grooming algorithm, based on the fixed-alternate routing approach. We introduce
  the grooming node selection (GNS) problem in MH-TG and propose three grooming policies,
  namely exhaustive sequential (ES), limited-hop sequential (LHS) and load sharing
  (LS) policies, to address the GNS problem. Given that the analysis of MH-TG is a
  relatively unexplored area, we propose an analytical model to evaluate the blocking
  performance of MH-TG using FOMH and the LS grooming policy. To address the multi-layered
  routing and multi-rate connection characteristics of traffic grooming, we introduce
  a novel multi-level decomposition approach in our analytical model which decomposes
  traffic at four different levels, namely alternate path, connection route, lightpath
  and link levels. The Erlang fixed-point approximation method is used to solve the
  analytical model. Numerical results show that analytical results matches well with
  simulation results. We also evaluate the effect of the grooming policies, the number
  of virtual hops (lightpaths) within a connection route and the number of alternate
  paths on the performance of the grooming algorithm.
