abstract: In this paper, we propose a loss tolerant reliable (LTR) data transport
  mechanism for dynamic event sensing (LT-RES) in WSNs. In LTRES, a reliable event
  sensing requirement at the transport layer is dynamically determined by the sink.
  A distributed source rate adaptation mechanism is designed, incorporating a loss
  rate based lightweight congestion control mechanism, to regulate the data traffic
  injected into the network so that the reliability requirement can be satisfied.
  An equation based fair rate control algorithm is used to improve the fairness among
  the LTRES flows sharing the congestion path. The performance evaluations show that
  LTRES can provide LTR data transport service for multiple events with short convergence
  time, low lost rate and high overall bandwidth utilization.
