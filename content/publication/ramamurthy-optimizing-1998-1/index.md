abstract: Optical networks based on passive-star couplers and employing WDM have been
  proposed for deployment in local and metropolitan areas. These networks suffer from
  splitting, coupling, and attenuation losses. Since there is an upper bound on transmitter
  power and a lower bound on receiver sensitivity, optical amplifiers are usually
  required to compensate for the power losses mentioned above. Due to the high cost
  of amplifiers, it is desirable to minimize their total number in the network. However,
  an optical amplifier has constraints on the maximum gain and the maximum output
  power it can supply; thus, optical amplifier placement becomes a challenging problem.
  In fact, the general problem of minimizing the total amplifier count is a mixed-integer
  nonlinear problem. Previous studies have attacked the amplifier-placement problem
  by adding the \"artificial\" constraint that all wavelengths, which are present
  at a particular point in a fiber, be at the same power level. This constraint simplifies
  the problem into a solvable mixed-integer linear program. Unfortunately, this artificial
  constraint can miss feasible solutions that have a lower amplifier count but do
  not have the equally powered wavelengths constraint. In this paper, we present a
  method to solve the minimum-amplifier-placement problem, while avoiding the equally
  powered wavelength constraint. We demonstrate that, by allowing signals to operate
  at different power levels, our method can reduce the number of amplifiers required.
