abstract: 'As a result of the growing popularity of wireless networks, in particular
  ad hoc networks, security over such networks has become very important. In this
  paper, we study the problem of secure group communications (SGC) and key management
  over ad hoc networks. We identify the key features of any SGC protocol for such
  networks. We also propose an efficient key agreement scheme for SGC. The scheme
  solves two important problems that exist in most current SGC schemes: requirement
  of member serialization and existence of a central entity. Besides this, the protocol
  also has many highly desirable properties such as contributory and efficient computation
  of group key, uniform work load for all the members, few rounds of rekeying (2 rounds
  for the initial key formation and join and 1 round for leave), and efficient support
  for high dynamics. These properties make the protocol well suited for wireless ad
  hoc networks.'
