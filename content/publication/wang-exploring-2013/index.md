abstract: 'Most of the commercial peer-to-peer (P2P) video streaming deployments support
  hundreds of channels and are referred to as multichannel systems. Recent research
  studies have proposed specific protocols to improve the streaming quality for all
  channels by enabling cross-channel cooperation among multiple channels. In this
  paper, we focus on the following fundamental problems in designing cooperating multichannel
  systems: 1) what are the general characteristics of existing and potential designs?
  and 2) under what circumstances should a particular design be used to achieve the
  desired streaming quality with the lowest implementation complexity? To answer the
  first question, we propose simple models based on linear programming and network-flow
  graphs for three general designs, namely Naive Bandwidth allocation Approach (NBA),
  Passive Channel-aware bandwidth allocation Approach (PCA), and Active Channel-aware
  bandwidth allocation Approach (ACA), which provide insight into understanding the
  key characteristics of cross-channel resource sharing. For the second question,
  we first develop closed-form results for two-channel systems. Then, we use extensive
  numerical simulations to compare the three designs for various peer population distributions,
  upload bandwidth distributions, and channel structures. Our analytical and simulation
  results show that: 1) the NBA design can rarely achieve the desired streaming quality
  in general cases; 2) the PCA design can achieve the same performance as the ACA
  design in general cases; and 3) the ACA design should be used for special applications.'
