abstract: Software Defined Networking (SDN) is driving transformations in Research
  and Education (R&E) networks, enabling innovations in network research, enhancing
  network performance, and providing security through a policydriven network management
  framework. The Holland Computing Center (HCC) at the University of Nebraska-Lincoln
  (UNL) supports scientists studying large datasets, and has identified a need for
  flexibility in network management and security, particularly with respect to identifying
  data flows. This problem is addressed through the deployment of a production SDN
  with a focus on integrating network resource management for large-scale GridFTP
  data transfers. We propose SNAG (SDN-managed Network Architecture for GridFTP transfers),
  an architecture that enables the SDN-based network management of GridFTP file transfers
  for large-scale science datasets. We also show how SNAG can efficiently and securely
  identify science dataset transfers from projects such as Compact Muon Solenoid (CMS)
  and Laser Interferometer Gravitational-Wave Observatory (LIGO). We focus on exposing
  an Application Program Interface (API) between the trusted GridFTP process and the
  network layer allowing the network to track flows via application metadata.
