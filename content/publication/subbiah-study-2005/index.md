abstract: 'Process engineering, process design and simulation, process supervision,
  control and estimation, process fault detection and diagnosis rely on the effective
  processing of unpredictable and imprecise information. A majority of applications
  require cooperation of two or more independently designed, separately located, but
  mutually affecting subsystems. In addition to good behavior of each of the subsystems,
  an effective coordination is very important to achieve the desired overall performance.
  Such a co-ordination can permit the use of commercially designed subsystems to perform
  more sophisticated tasks than at present and improve the operational reliability.
  However, such a co-ordination is very difficult to attain mainly due to the lack
  of precise system models and/or dynamic parameters. In such situations, the evolvable
  hardware (EHW) techniques, which can achieve the sophisticated level of information
  processing the brain is capable of, can excel. In this paper, a new multiple-sensor
  coordinator based sensor validation scheme combining the techniques of evolvable
  hardware and neural networks, is presented. The idea of this work is to develop
  a system that is resistant or tolerant to sensor failures (fault tolerance) by utilizing
  multiple sensor inputs connected to a programmable VLSI chip. The proposed system
  can be views as process modeling formalism and given the appropriate network topology;
  is capable of characterizing non linear functional relationships. The structure
  of the resulting evolvable hardware based process model can be considered generic,
  in the sense that little prior process knowledge is required. The knowledge about
  the plant dynamics and mapping characteristics are implicitly stored within the
  network. The proposed system help in extending the range of operation of the conventional
  control systems with respect to sensor validation at no extra (hardware) costs.
  The proposed design algorithms focus on using the characteristics that evolved systems
  present like, for example adaptation, auto-regulation and learning. The proposed
  sensor was tested for its effectiveness by introducing different sensor failures
  such as: sensor fails as open circuit, sensor fails as short circuit, multiple sensor
  failure etc. on a real time plant and in each case the performance index was computed
  and found to be acceptable.'
