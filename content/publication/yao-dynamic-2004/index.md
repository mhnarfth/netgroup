abstract: There is a mismatch between lightpath channel capacity and traffic request
  capacity in wavelength division multiplexed (WDM) optical mesh networks. Traffic
  grooming is needed to resolve this mismatch in an efficient way. We study the dynamic
  traffic grooming problem in WDM mesh networks using the fixed-alternate routing
  (FAR) approach. Based on the FAR approach, we propose the fixed-order grooming (FOG)
  algorithm to support on-line provisioning of multi-granularity subwavelength connections.
  As traffic grooming involves two-layered routing, it is significantly different
  from the routing and wavelength assignment (RWA) problem in wavelength-routed WDM
  networks. We introduce the route selection problem (also called grooming node selection
  problem) and propose three grooming policies to address this problem. The three
  grooming policies are load sharing (LS), sequential grooming (SG) and minimum gap
  (MG). To address the wavelength and transceiver constraints, we propose another
  three grooming policies including least physical hop first (LPH), least virtual
  hop first (LVH) and least stringent resource first (LSR). Simulations are conducted
  to evaluate the performance of the FOG grooming algorithm and the grooming policies.
