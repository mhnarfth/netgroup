abstract: Advanced distributed applications in engineering, scientific and business
  domains that are highly data-intensive demand high-performance computing platforms.
  Grid networks based on optical technology provide a promising approach to create
  efficient infrastructure to support such applications. These networks, termed in
  general as Lambda Grid networks, are based on optical circuit switching and employ
  wavelength division multiplexing and optical lightpaths. In this paper, we propose
  an approach based on Tabu Search heuristic for joint scheduling of computing, network
  and storage resources in a Lambda Grid network. The objectives are to minimize cost
  by efficient usage of resources and to minimize total completion time of job execution.
  The results are compared to a Greedy approach. Simulation results from both the
  methods show that the Tabu search heuristic performed better than the greedy approach
  in optimizing both the cost and completion time objectives.
