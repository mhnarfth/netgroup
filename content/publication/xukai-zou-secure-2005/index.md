abstract: Secure group communication (SGC) with hierarchical access control (HAC)
  refers to a scenario in which a group of members is divided into a number of subgroups
  located at different privilege levels and a high-level subgroup can receive and
  decrypt messages within any of its descendant lower-level subgroups, while the reverse
  is not allowed. HAC is generally enforced using cryptography based techniques [Birget
  et al., 2001] ie, cryptographic keys play a primary role in the control of access
  rights. If the members of a higher level subgroup possess or can derive the key
  of a lower level subgroup, they have the right to access all messages within the
  lower level subgroup. In this chapter, we discuss several typical SGC schemes with
  HAC.
