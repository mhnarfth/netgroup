abstract: 'Key management is a core mechanism to ensure the security of applications
  and network services in wireless sensor networks. It includes two aspects: key distribution
  and key revocation. Many key management protocols have been specifically designed
  for wireless sensor networks. However, most of the key management protocols focus
  on the establishment of the required keys or the removal of the compromised keys.
  The design of these key management protocols does not consider the support of higher
  level security applications. When the applications are integrated later in sensor
  networks, new mechanisms must be designed. In this paper, we propose a security
  framework, uKeying, for wireless sensor networks. This framework can be easily extended
  to support many security applications. It includes three components: a security
  mechanism to provide secrecy for communications in sensor networks, an efficient
  session key distribution scheme, and a centralized key revocation scheme. The proposed
  framework does not depend on a specific key distribution scheme and can be used
  to support many security applications, such as secure group communications. Our
  analysis shows that the framework is secure, efficient, and extensible. The simulation
  and results also reveal for the first time that a centralized key revocation scheme
  can also attain a high efficiency.'
