abstract: As the complexity of deployments increases, network managers face two problems
  that we address in this paper. First, the deployment of middleboxes in choke points
  (between two routers through which all traffic flows), raises concerns regarding
  robustness, correctness and efficiency. Second, dynamically managing traffic isolation
  in a network is a very tedious task. In this paper we propose using Software Defined
  Networks (SDN) and OpenFlow to simplify network management by addressing these two
  challenges. SDN consists of decoupling the control and data planes of a network.
  OpenFlow standardizes the way that the controller communicates with the network
  devices in an SDN architecture. To overcome the challenge faced by deploying middleboxes
  in choke points, we show how these appliances can be deployed at waypoints. In this
  architecture, a waypoint is only traversed by traffic that needs further processing.
  The remaining data flows through the network without being processed by the middlebox.
  We have developed an application that implements an encryption processing unit that
  works as a waypoint and we show how OpenFlow can be used to route through the encryption
  unit only the traffic that requires encryption. To overcome the challenge of dynamic
  traffic isolation, we show how a network manager can use an application to create,
  delete and modify virtual local area networks (VLANs) in a dynamic way to achieve
  traffic isolation. Our implementation provides a GUI to the user so that the administration
  of the VLANs is greatly simplified.
