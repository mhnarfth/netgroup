abstract: Electro-optic and wavelength conversion are the cornerstones of optical
  networking. Therefore, a complete chapter is devoted to this topic. The E/O/E conversion
  allows electronic equipment to interface with the optical components and networks,
  whereas the wavelength converters enable much better utilization of network, reduced
  blocking rate, and superior network survivability. This chapter provides an overview
  of the need for electro-optic and wavelength conversion, enabling technologies that
  have made them possible, design methods, and analytical models used in wavelength
  convertible networks. Finally, this chapter describes the advantages of wavelength
  conversion.
