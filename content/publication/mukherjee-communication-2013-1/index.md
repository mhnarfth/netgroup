abstract: Future space exploration demands a Space Network that will be able to connect
  spacecrafts with one another and in turn with Earth's terrestrial Internet and hence
  efficiently transfer data back and forth. Currently there are hundreds of active
  space programs around the world that communicate in outer space. However, the concept
  of an Interplanetary Internet (IPN) is only in its incubation stage. Considerable
  amount of common standards and research is required before widespread deployment
  occurs to make IPN feasible. This paper presents a concise picture of the current
  space networking technologies and architectures. It discusses the Interplanetary
  Internet and Delay Tolerant Networking (DTN) concepts along with the various space
  networks that are currently deployed. The paper also identifies the significant
  areas of space network design and operation that still require extensive research
  and development.
