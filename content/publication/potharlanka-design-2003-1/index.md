abstract: Optical communication networks can support very high bandwidth because of
  the maturity of the wavelength-division multiplexing (WDM) technique. WDM transport
  systems with tera-bit-per-second (Tbps) capacity on a single strand of fiber are
  commercially available now; however, a number of technical challenges remain to
  be addressed before optical networks become the effective basis for a robust, high-capacity,
  and scalable next-generation information infrastructure. One such challenge is the
  development of standardized architectures and protocols for optical networks, appropriate
  at very high speeds, under different environments such as local, metro, and long-haul
  networks. Although experimentation on a test-bed will reveal useful information
  about these issues, a simulation tool that can provide rapid and accurate analysis
  of various design choices is now essential for timely resolution of the engineering
  challenges posed by optical networks. In an optical network environment, simulation
  is often the dominant tool to analyze network behavior. For this purpose, we have
  designed and developed a tool called ARTHUR (A Routing And Wavelength Assignment
  Tool For Optical Networks). ARTHUR supports several useful features such as dynamic
  routing and wavelength assignment, wavelength conversion, and fault-management.
  ARTHUR can be used as a network design and planning tool and as
