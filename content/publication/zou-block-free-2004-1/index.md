abstract: Secure group communication (SGC) has been an active research area because
  several applications require it. In this paper, we propose a Block-Free Group Tree-based
  Diffie-Hellman (BF-TGDH) key agreement protocol, based on a recently proposed Group
  Tree-based Diffie-Hellman (TGDH) key agreement protocol, for secure group communication.
  The new protocol has the following specific properties:(1) no blocking during the
  rekeying process and seamless group communication without any interruption;(2) resistance
  to the Man-in-the-Middle attack;(3) authentication of message senders using inherent
  (ElGamal) signature protocol.
