abstract: Increasingly, academic campus networks support large-scale data transfer
  workflows for data-intensive science. These data transfers rely on high-performance,
  scalable, and reliable protocols for moving large amounts of data over a high-bandwidth,
  high-latency network. GridFTP is a widely used protocol for wide area network (WAN)
  data movement. However, as the GridFTP protocol does not share connection information
  with the network-layer, network operators have reduced flexibility, particularly
  in identifying/managing flows across the network. We address this problem by deploying
  a production “ application-aware ” software defined network (SDN) for managing GridFTP
  transfers for data-intensive science workflows. We first propose a novel application-aware
  architecture called SNAG (SDN-managed Network Architecture for GridFTP transfers).
  SNAG combines application-layer and network-layer collaboration (termed “application-awareness”)
  with SDN-enabled network management to classify, monitor and to manage network resources
  actively. Until now, our SNAG deployment has successfully classified over 1.5 Billion
  GridFTP connections at the Holland Computing Center (HCC), University of Nebraska-Lincoln
  (UNL). Next, we develop an application-aware SDN system to provide differentiated
  network services for distributed computing workflows. At HCC, we also demonstrate
  how our system ensures the quality of service (QoS) for high-throughput workflows
  such as Compact Muon Solenoid (CMS) and Laser Interferometer Gravitational-Wave
  Observatory (LIGO). Further, we also demonstrate how application-aware SDN can be
  exploited to create policy-driven approaches to achieve accurate resource accounting
  for each workflow. We present strategies for implementing differentiated network
  services and discuss their capacity improvement benefits. Lastly, we provide some
  guidelines and recommendations for developing application-aware SDN architectures
  for general-purpose applications.
