abstract: Real-time communication is crucial for wireless sensor networks (WSNs) to
  accomplish collaborative event sensing tasks with specific timing constraints. In
  this work, a service-differentiated real-time communication scheme (SDRCS) is developed
  to provide soft real-time guarantees for event-based traffic in WSNs. SDRCS features
  a cross-layer packet forwarding design to integrate the real-time routing functionality
  with a novel prioritized medium access control scheme. Based on this design, SDRCS
  performs distributed packet traversal speed estimation for traffic classification
  and admission control. SDRCS also performs prioritized packet forwarding so that
  the routing decisions are locally performed for maximized packet traversal speed.
  SDRCS requires no extra hardware for localization, transmission power adaptation
  or multi-channel transmission. It also adapts well to network dynamics, such as
  channel quality and communication voids. Performance evaluations show that SDRCS
  significantly improves the on-time delivery ratio and service-differentiation granularity
  for mixed priority traffic flows in unsynchronized WSNs, compared with currently
  used communication schemes. SDRCS also provides higher end-to-end throughput in
  terms of supporting higher source data rates with tight end-to-end latency requirements.
