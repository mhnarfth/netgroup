abstract: Network management for applications that rely on large-scale data transfers
  is challenging due to the volatility and the dynamic nature of the access traffic
  patterns. Predictive analytics and forecasting play an important role in providing
  effective resource allocation strategies for large data transfers. We propose a
  predictive analytics solution for large data transfers using an application-aware
  software defined networking (SDN) approach. We perform extensive exploratory data
  analysis to characterize the GridFTP connection transfers dataset and present various
  strategies for its use with statistical forecasting models. We develop a univariate
  autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA) based prediction framework for
  forecasting GridFTP connection transfers. Our prediction model tightly integrates
  with an application-aware SDN solution to preemptively drive network management
  decisions for GridFTP resource allocation at a U.S. CMS Tier-2 site. Further, our
  framework has a mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) ranging from 6% to 10% when
  applied to make rolling forecasts.
