This project aims to develop advanced AI and machine learning-based solutions to secure smart grid systems. 

The research specifically targets the security of customer premises equipment, such as smart meters, by implementing smart authentication techniques and real-time traffic analysis. By leveraging network- and application-layer collaboration and distributed threat intelligence frameworks, the project seeks to detect and mitigate anomalous behavior within the smart grid network. The teamâ€™s innovative approach includes developing device fingerprinting methods to prevent unauthorized access and using predictive analytics to improve network visibility and resource management.

This joint effort not only aims to strengthen the security of smart grid cyberinfrastructures but also to contribute to cybersecurity education by incorporating new findings into undergraduate and graduate courses. The project, set to run through December 2023 with a provisional extension to December 2024, is poised to make a significant impact on smart grid security and establish a foundation for future research with potential federal funding.
