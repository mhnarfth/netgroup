abstract: Lightpath scheduling is an important capability in next-generation wavelength-division
  multiplexing (WDM) optical networks to reserve resources in advance for a specified
  time period while provisioning end-to-end lightpaths. In this study, we propose
  an approach to support dynamic lightpath scheduling in such networks. To minimize
  blocking probability in a network that accommodates dynamic scheduled lightpath
  demands (D- SLDs), resource allocation should be optimized in a dynamic manner.
  However, for the network users who desire deterministic services, resources must
  be reserved in advance and guaranteed for future use. These two objectives may be
  mutually incompatible. Therefore, we propose a two-phase dynamic lightpath scheduling
  approach to tackle this issue. The first phase is the deterministic lightpath scheduling
  phase. When a lightpath request arrives, the network control plane schedules a path
  with guaranteed resources so that the user can get a quick response with the deterministic
  lightpath schedule. The second phase is the lightpath re-optimization phase, in
  which the network control plane re-provisions some already scheduled lightpaths.
  Experimental results show that our proposed two-phase dynamic lightpath scheduling
  approach can greatly reduce WDM network blocking.
