abstract: 'Connection requests for data-intensive applications often require specific
  start time and end time/duration when they are submitted. With the additional time
  domain information, cost efficient connections can be established. In this paper,
  we propose two capital expenditure (CapEx) optimized approaches: Multi-Layer (ML)
  approach and Transponder/Regenerator Reuse (TRR) approach. Integer Linear Programming
  (ILP) is used to formulate the routing, wavelength assignment and regenerator/multiplexer
  placement problem in a complex multi-layer optical network and provide lower bounds
  for the optimized CapEx value. Due to the time and space complexity of ILP, we also
  propose a greedy algorithm and a tabu-search algorithm to solve the same problem
  in a less time and resource consuming way. Finally, we compare the results in terms
  of computing time and optimized CapEx value across the ILP, greedy heuristic and
  tabu search heuristic methods with the ML approach for the Internet2 topology and
  a 6-node ring topology. The performance of all three methods with TRR approach is
  also tested with the same input traffic. The results show 30% to 40% less CapEx
  when comparing ML with TRR. Further, our tabu search heuristic can achieve near
  optimal results compared to ILP.'
