abstract: Wireless LANs are growing rapidly and security has always been a concern.
  We have implemented a hybrid system, which does not only detect active attacks such
  as identity theft causing denial of service attacks, but also detects the usage
  of accesspoint discovery tools. The system responds in real time by sending out
  an alert to the network administrator.
