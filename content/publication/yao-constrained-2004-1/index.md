abstract: This paper addresses the two-layer routing problem in wavelength division
  multiplexed (WDM) optical mesh networks subject to resource constraints and generalized
  wavelength continuity (GWC) constraint. The GWC constraint is a relaxed wavelength
  continuity constraint in networks which have different kinds of wavelength conversion
  capabilities. As an improvement over the existing approach which represents each
  wavelength separately in the auxiliary graph, we introduce a largely simplified
  link bundled auxiliary graph (LBAG) and propose a new,method to find paths and assign
  wavelengths for new lightpaths subject to the GWC constraint. We propose a constrained
  grooming algorithm based on the LBAG model. We also propose two grooming policies
  which improve the existing grooming policies by integrating the wavelength and transceiver
  metrics and considering the relative resource utilization ratio. Simulations are
  conducted to evaluate the performance of the grooming policies in terms of blocking
  probability.
