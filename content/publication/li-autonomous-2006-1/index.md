abstract: Employing waveband switching (WBS) in WDM networks can reduce the network
  operational cost and the call blocking probability. However, upgrading the existing
  optical switching architecture requires time and money. It is expected that a heterogeneous
  waveband switching (HeteroWBS) architecture would be desirable, where some nodes
  can support WBS functions and some cannot. We study the performance of HeteroWBS
  networks in terms of call blocking probability and cost savings under dynamic traffic
  requests. We propose an autonomous clustering-based HeteroWBS (AS-HeteroWBS) architecture
  to clusters the network into multiple autonomous systems (ASs). An AS may contain
  some specific nodes that provide WBS functions for all the nodes in the AS. Based
  on the architecture, three HeteroWBS algorithms are proposed. Our simulation results
  show that the HeteroWBS algorithms can achieve optimal cost savings while maintaining
  the same network throughput compared with the algorithm without WBS.
