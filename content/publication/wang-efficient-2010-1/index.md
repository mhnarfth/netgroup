abstract: 'The goal of key management is to establish the required keys between sensor
  nodes which exchange data. A key management protocol includes two aspects: key distribution
  and key revocation. Key distribution has been extensively studied in the context
  of sensor networks. However, key revocation has received relatively little attention.
  In this paper, we first review and summarize the current key revocation schemes
  for sensor networks. Then, we present an efficient scheme, KeyRev, for removing
  compromised sensor nodes from a wireless sensor network (WSN). Unlike most proposed
  key revocation schemes focusing on removing the compromised keys on the sensor nodes,
  the KeyRev scheme uses key update techniques to obsolesce the keys owned by the
  compromised sensor nodes and thus remove the nodes from the network. We analyze
  the security of the KeyRev scheme and compare its performance against another centralized
  key revocation scheme and a distributed key revocation scheme. Our analyses show
  that the KeyRev scheme is secure in spite of not removing the pre-distributed key
  materials at compromised sensor nodes. Simulation results also indicate that the
  KeyRev scheme is scalable and performs very well compared with other key revocation
  schemes in WSNs. Copyright Â© 2008 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.'
