abstract: 'Next-generation optical transport networks will automatically and dynamically
  provision end-to-end connections. In this paper, we study the problem of inter-domain
  dynamic routing under a multi-layer multi-domain network model, which allows the
  end-to-end connections to be set up not only across multiple routing domains but
  also through two transport layers: the optical layer and the digital layer. In this
  model, a connection can traverse the domain boundary either through optical bypass
  or through optical-electrical-optical (O/E/O) processing. We propose an inter-domain
  dynamic routing scheme with modest time complexity to address the problem from an
  algorithmic perspective.'
