abstract: Blockchains are known to provide verifiable tamper-resistant trails of accepted
  transactions. This guarantee comes at the considerable cost of storage and computational
  power, thereby restricting its application. Current research has focused on alternatives
  such as proof of reputation, proof of stake, and proof of elapsed-time to reduce
  the computational burden on the blockchain participants. Orthogonal to this effort,
  we focus on a specific set of applications that cannot commit much storage space
  and computational resources, but require only reasonable guarantees on the validity
  of transactions. To this end, we introduce blockchain design alternatives, collectively
  called ApproxBC, that can provide proof of transactions with provable confidence
  bounds. Consequently, ApproxBC can considerably reduce the computation and storage
  resources required, making them suitable for resource-constrained Internet of Things
  environments. We also showcase two approximation-tolerant applications that can
  leverage the quicker computation and smaller storage requirements.
