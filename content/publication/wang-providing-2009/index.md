abstract: Most of the literature on peer-to-peer (P2P) live streaming focuses on how
  to provide best-effort streaming quality by efficiently using the system bandwidth;
  however, there is no guarantee about the provided streaming quality. This paper
  considers how to provide statistically guaranteed streaming quality to a P2P live
  streaming system. We study a class of admission control algorithms which statistically
  guarantee that a P2P live streaming system has sufficient overall bandwidth. Our
  results show that there is a tradeoff between the user blocking rate and user-behavior
  insensitivity (i.e., whether the system performance is insensitive to the fine statistics
  of user behaviors). We also find that the system performance is more sensitive to
  the distribution change of user inter-arrival times than to that of user lifetimes.
