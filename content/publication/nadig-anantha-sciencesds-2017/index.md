abstract: Experimental science workflows from projects such as Compact Muon Solenoid
  (CMS) and Laser Interferometer Gravitational Wave Observatory (LIGO) are characterized
  by data-intensive computational tasks over large datasets transferred over encrypted
  channels. The Science DMZ approach to network design favors lossless packet forwarding
  through a separate isolated network over secure lossy forwarding through stateful
  packet processors (e.g. firewalls). We propose ScienceSDS, a novel software defined
  security framework for securely monitoring large-scale science datasets over a software
  defined networking and network functions virtualization (SDN/NFV) infrastructure.
