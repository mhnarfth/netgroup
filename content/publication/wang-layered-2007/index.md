abstract: 'In this paper, we propose a layered clustering hierarchy (LCH) communication
  protocol for wireless sensor networks (WSNs). The design of LCH has two goals: scalability
  and energy-efficiency. In LCH, the sensor nodes are organized as a layered clustering
  structure. Each layer runs a distributed clustering protocol. By randomizing the
  rotation of cluster heads in each layer, the energy load is distributed evenly across
  sensors in the network. Our simulations show that LCH is effective in densely deployed
  sensor networks. On average, 70% of live sensor nodes are involved directly in the
  clustering communication hierarchy. Moreover, the simulations also show that the
  energy load and dead nodes are distributed evenly over the network. As studies prove
  that the performance of LCH depends mainly on the distributed clustering protocol,
  the location of cluster heads and cluster size are two critical factors in the design
  of LCH.'
