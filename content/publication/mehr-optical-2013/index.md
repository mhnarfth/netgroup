abstract: The availability and reliability of optical backbone links are very important
  to ensure the efficient operation of the Internet. To address the issue of data
  loss due to optical link failures, there is a need for an optimal recovery strategy
  so that the traffic can be rerouted on a backup path to the destination. This paper
  builds on top of our prior research efforts (Yavary Mehr et al., 2022; Zhou et al.,
  2017) which introduced the concept of Resource Delayed Release (RDR) by adding a
  new state called ”idle state” which begins when the channel has completed carrying
  its services so that the next request can be carried immediately instead of waiting
  for a new channel to be established. While RDR improves the network performance
  by reducing the service provisioning time and blocking probability, it does not
  handle link failures which are quite common in optical networks. Therefore, enhancing
  RDR with protection strategies will make the network more reliable and thus we investigate
  this topic in this work. In this paper, we evaluate four different protection methods
  for single link failure recovery in WDM networks (Path Protection (PP), Partial
  Path Protection (PPP), Segment Protection (SegP) and Link Protection (LP)) with
  two different routing approaches namely Shortest Path (SPath) and Greedy (G) algorithm
  under uniform and non-uniform traffic generated using real traffic traces collected
  from a local Internet Service Provider (ISP). Special attention while evaluating
  these protection strategies was paid to the optimization of the amount of remaining
  bandwidth. The performance evaluation of the network under uniform and non-uniform
  traffic was done over the NSFNet and COST239 topologies by employing the metrics
  of link and network utilization, Blocking Probability (BP), Bandwidth Blocking Probability
  (BBP), Recovery Time (RT) and Service Provisioning Time (SPT). Our results show
  that the PPP method performs the best in terms of reducing BP, BBP, and SPT compared
  with PP, LP, and SegP in all three topologies while utilizing RDR.
