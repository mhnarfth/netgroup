abstract: Interplanetary Internet or Interplanetary Networking is envisaged as a space
  network which interconnects spacecrafts, satellites, rovers and orbiters of different
  planets and comets for efficient exchange of scientific data such as telemetry and
  images. In this paper, we implement a layout of the Interplanetary Internet (IPN)
  with the Interplanetary Overlay Network (ION) software module that uses Contact
  Graph Routing (CGR). The experiments are then implemented on the Global Environment
  for Network Innovations (GENI) testbed. Along with realistic contact plans (CP)
  of the nodes, this network implementation was used to run experiments testing the
  performance of Delay Tolerant Networking (DTN) with and without cross links between
  Mars orbiters. The experiments showed that in an Earth-Mars communication network
  using two Mars orbiters, allowing cross links between the orbiters results in increasing
  the amount of data transferred by roughly 9.2%. Data sent from Mars Rover to the
  Earth stations also increases by 35.7% when a third satellite (Mars Express) was
  added to the network without cross links. Finally, when cross links are allowed
  across all satellites orbiting Mars and serving as relay nodes between the Earth
  stations and Mars rover, the communication was enhanced by almost 46%. We conclude
  that by adding cross links, the performance of the network is enhanced for a better
  transmission of data from Mars to the Earth, which is very pertinent for the scalability
  of the network.
