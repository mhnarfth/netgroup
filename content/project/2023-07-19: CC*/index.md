Dr. Byrav Ramamurthy has secured a significant grant from the National Science Foundation (NSF) for his project, "Network Cyberinfrastructure Innovation with an Intelligent Real-Time Traffic Analysis Framework and Application-Aware Networking." 

This groundbreaking research seeks to transform network cyberinfrastructure by utilizing machine learning techniques for advanced traffic analysis and application-aware networking solutions.

The project focuses on developing a scalable framework for real-time network flow analysis, utilizing Just-In-Time (JIT) machine learning approaches to enhance decision-making capabilities within campus cyberinfrastructures. By integrating data from both campus networks and Internet2, the research aims to transform how network traffic is analyzed and managed.

## **Key objectives of the project include:**

**Real-Time Traffic Analysis:** The development of online-offline machine learning approaches for real-time network traffic analysis and prediction, providing insights that surpass traditional offline methods.

**Scalable Network Flow Analysis:** Implementing theoretical models to transform, index, and build search techniques for analyzing network flow data at an internet-scale in real-time.

**Application-Aware Networking:** Utilizing software-defined networking (SDN) control strategies for application-aware data transfers, enabling greater flexibility in network management and service differentiation for scientific data transfers.

This research is supported by collaborations with the Holland Computing Center (HCC) at the University of Nebraska-Lincoln, the Open Science Grid Consortium (OSG), Argonne National Lab (ANL), and Internet2. The techniques and frameworks developed will be made available to the open-source community, benefiting various science applications within Research and Education (R&E) networks.

In addition to advancing the field of network cyberinfrastructure, the project is committed to enriching educational opportunities for students at the University of Nebraska-Lincoln's School of Computing and conducting outreach events for the broader community.

This NSF award recognizes the project's potential to make significant contributions to network cyberinfrastructure innovation, highlighting Dr. Ramamurthy's leadership in advancing research with substantial intellectual merit and broader impacts.
