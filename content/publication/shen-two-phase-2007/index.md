abstract: Lightpath scheduling is an important capability in next-generation wavelength-division
  multiplexing (WDM) optical networks to reserve resources in advance for a specified
  time period while provisioning end-to-end lightpaths. In a dynamic environment,
  the end user requests for dynamic scheduled lightpath demands (D-SLDs) need to be
  serviced without the knowledge of future requests. Even though the starting time
  of the request may be hours or days from the current time, the end-user however
  expects a quick response as to whether the request could be satisfied. We propose
  a two- phase approach to dynamically schedule and provision D-SLDs. In the first
  phase, termed the deterministic lightpath scheduling phase, upon arrival of a lightpath
  request, the network control plane schedules a path with guaranteed resources so
  that the user can get a quick response with a deterministic lightpath schedule.
  In the second phase, termed the lightpath re-optimization phase, we re-provision
  some already scheduled lightpaths to re-optimize for improving network performance.
  We study two re- optimization scenarios to reallocate network resources while maintaining
  the existing lightpath schedules. Experimental results show that our proposed two-phase
  dynamic lightpath scheduling approach can greatly reduce network blocking.
