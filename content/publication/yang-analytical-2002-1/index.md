abstract: An analytical model for virtual topology reconfiguration (VTR) in optical
  networks is developed. It aims at the optical networks with a circuit-based data
  plane and an IP-like control plane. By identifying and analyzing the important factors
  impacting the network performance due to VTR operations on both planes, we can compare
  the benefits and penalties of different VTR algorithms and policies. The best VTR
  scenario can be adaptively chosen from a set of such algorithms and policies according
  to the real-time network situations. For this purpose, a cost model integrating
  all these factors is created to provide a comparison criterion independent of any
  specific VTR algorithm and policy. A case study based on simulation experiments
  is conducted to illustrate the application of our models.
