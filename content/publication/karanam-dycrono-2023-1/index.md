abstract: 'In this paper, we present Dynamic Cross-layer Network Orchestration (DyCroNO),
  a dynamic service provisioning and load balancing mechanism for IP over optical
  networks. DyCroNO comprises of the following components: i) an end-end (E2E) service
  provisioning and virtual path allocation algorithm, ii) a lightweight dynamic bandwidth
  adjustment strategy that leverages the extended duration statistics to ensure optimal
  network utilization and guarantee the quality-of-service (QoS), and iii) a load
  distribution mechanism to optimize the network load distribution at runtime. As
  another contribution, we design a real-time deep learning technique to predict the
  network load distribution. We implemented a Long Short-Term Memory-based (LSTM)
  method with a sliding window technique to dynamically (at runtime) predict network
  load distributions at various lead times. Simulations were performed over three
  topologies: NSFNet, Cost266 and Eurolarge using real-world traffic traces to model
  the traffic patterns. Results show that our approach lowers the mean link load and
  total resources significantly while improving the resource utilization when compared
  to existing approaches. Additionally, our deep learning-based method showed promising
  results in load distribution prediction with low root mean squared error (RMSE)
  and âˆ¼90% accuracy.'
