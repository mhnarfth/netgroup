abstract: 'Previous studies have solved many variations of the routing and wavelength
  assignment (RWA) problem in optical networks under the assumption of perfect conditions
  regarding the power of a signal. In this paper, we investigate the RWA problem while
  allowing for degradation of routed signals by optical components. The problem is
  formulated as a mixed-integer non-linear program. We propose a two-phase approach.
  In the first phase, we solve the pure RWA problem using fixed routes for every connection.
  In the second phase, power assignment is accomplished by either using a heuristic
  or using a genetic algorithm. This paper demonstrates that: (i) connections do interact
  affecting the power of each other, and (ii) global search meta-heuristics provide
  better solutions.'
