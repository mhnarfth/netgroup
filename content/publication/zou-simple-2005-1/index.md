abstract: Many group key agreement protocols (GKA) for secure group communication
  (SGC) based on the Diffie-Hellman key exchange principle have been proposed in literature.
  All of these protocols require member serialization and/or existence of a central
  entity. In this paper, we propose a simple group Diffie-Hellman key agreement protocol
  which removes these two limitations. Moreover, the new protocol needs minimum (two)
  rounds of rekeying process and efficiently support high dynamics.
