abstract: Content-based routing has emerged as a new routing paradigm, allowing messages
  to be routed based on defined fields within the message. Content-based routers generally
  employ XML, which has two main disadvantages. First, each message is translated
  into XML when sent, and translated out of XML when received. Second, XML limits
  the objects sent to three typesâ€”data, documents, and messages. We introduce here
  an extensible content-based object router that goes beyond messages to routing entire
  Java objects. The Java Object Router (JOR) is an application-level router that allows
  Java objects to be routed according to their IP address, their label, their object
  type, or any of their content. In addition, JOR provides mechanisms to deal with
  varying routing policies. JOR separates routing mechanisms from routing policies,
  making it adaptable and easy to use in a variety of applications. To illustrate
  the advantages and performance of JOR, a prototype was implemented to experimentally
  evaluate the content-based object routing mechanisms.
