abstract: With ever-increasing demands on capacity, quality of service, speed, and
  reliability, current Internet systems are under strain and under review. Combining
  contributions from experts in the field, this book captures the most recent and
  innovative designs, architectures, protocols, and mechanisms that will enable researchers
  to successfully build the next-generation Internet. A broad perspective is provided,
  with topics including innovations at the physical/transmission layer in wired and
  wireless media, as well as the support for new switching and routing paradigms at
  the device and sub-system layer. The proposed alternatives to TCP and UDP at the
  data transport layer for emerging environments are also covered, as are the novel
  models and theoretical foundations proposed for understanding network complexity.
  Finally, new approaches for pricing and network economics are discussed, making
  this ideal for students, researchers, and practitioners who need to know about designing,
  constructing, and operating the next-generation Internet.
