abstract: Wireless LAN technology, despite the numerous advantages it has over competing
  technologies, has not seen widespread deployment. A primary reason for markets not
  adopting this technology is its failure to provide adequate security. Data that
  is sent over wireless links can be compromised with utmost ease. In this project,
  we propose a distributed agent based intrusion detection and response system for
  wireless LANs that can detect unauthorized wireless elements like access points,
  wireless clients that are in promiscuous mode etc. The system reacts to intrusions
  by either notifying the concerned personnel, in case of rogue access points and
  promiscuous nodes, or by blocking unauthorized users from accessing the network
  resources.
