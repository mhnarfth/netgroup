abstract: "Network planners are often requested to provision multiple physically-diverse
  high-speed circuits over a large carrier's core (inter-city) DWDM network, which
  consists of multiple layers and heterogeneous vendor systems. Optimally provisioning
  such circuits while avoiding shared risk link group (SRLG) failures is an NP-hard
  problem. In this paper, we propose a novel hybrid two-step approach: pre-processing
  with Integer Linear Programming (ILP) for diverse routing and postprocessing for
  regenerator placement and wavelength assignment. This approach has been implemented
  in a prototype network planning tool. According to our experiments, most of the
  cases for a typical large carrier's core transport network can be solved within
  1 minute, even with tens of thousands of binary decision variables, which allows
  interactive use by network planners."
