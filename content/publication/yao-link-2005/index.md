abstract: This paper addresses the two-layer dynamic traffic grooming problem in wavelength-division-multiplexed
  (WDM) mesh optical networks subject to resource constraints and the generalized
  wavelength continuity (GWC) constraint. The GWC constraint is a relaxed wavelength
  continuity constraint which incorporates various kinds of wavelength conversion
  capabilities that exist in optical networks. As an improvement over the existing
  layered auxiliary graph (layered-AG) approach which represents each wavelength separately
  in the auxiliary graph, we introduce a largely simplified link bundled auxiliary
  graph (LBAG) model and propose the SAG-LB method to find paths and assign wavelengths
  for new lightpaths subject to the GWC constraint. We propose the constrained integrated
  grooming algorithm (CIGA) based on the LBAG model. A grooming policy influences
  the resource utilization by determining the weight function of the auxiliary graph.
  We propose the least resource path first (LR) grooming policy, which is an improvement
  over the existing grooming policies in the literature, by integrating the wavelength
  and transceiver metrics together. Simulation results show that the LBAG model achieves
  a comparable blocking performance with the layered-AG approach while using a significantly
  less amount of running time. We also present the worst case time complexity analysis
  of the CIGA grooming algorithm and evaluate the performance of the LR grooming policy
  by simulation.
