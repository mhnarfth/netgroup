abstract: "As more reliance is placed on computing and networking systems, the need
  for redundancy increases. The Common Address Redundancy Protocol (CARP) protocol
  and OpenBSD's pfsync utility provide a means by which to implement redundant routers
  and firewalls. This paper details how CARP and pfsync work together to provide this
  redundancy and explores the performance one can expect from the open source solutions.
  Two experiments were run: one showing the relationship between firewall state creation
  and state synchronization traffic and the other showing how TCP sessions are transparently
  maintained in the event of a router failure. Discussion of these simulations along
  with background information gives an overview of how OpenBSD, CARP, and pfsync can
  provide redundant routers and firewalls for today's Internet."
