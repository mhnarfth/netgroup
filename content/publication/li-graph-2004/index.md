abstract: The problem of waveband switching (WBS) in a wavelength-division multiplexing
  (WDM) mesh network with dynamic traffic requests is investigated. To solve the WBS
  problem in a homogeneous dynamic WBS network, where every node is a multigranular
  optical crossconnect (MG-OXC), we construct an auxiliary graph. Based on the auxiliary
  graph, we develop two heuristic on-line WBS algorithms with different grouping policies,
  namely the wavelength-first WBS algorithm based on the auxiliary graph (WFAUG) and
  the waveband-first WBS algorithm based on the auxiliary graph (BFAUG). Our results
  show that the WFAUG algorithm outperforms the BFAUG algorithm.
