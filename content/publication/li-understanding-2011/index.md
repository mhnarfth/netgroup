abstract: Nowadays, millions of Internet users watch and upload a large number of
  videos on User Generated Content (UGC) sites (e.g., Youtube) everyday. Moreover,
  online videos about hot events, such as breaking news and Olympic games, attract
  lots of users. In this paper, we study the characteristics of hot-event videos by
  collecting video traces of the largest UGC site in China for 28 days. We first empirically
  study statistical properties of such videos and find that hot-event videos contribute
  a large number of views, even though the total number of hot-event videos is relatively
  small. In addition, there exist extremely active uploaders and top 10% active uploaders
  upload over 60% videos. The video popularity demonstrates high skewness, where top
  5% the most popular videos contribute over 80% views. Finally, we analyze the popularity
  evolution of hot-event videos using the consecutive 28-day video traces. The popularity
  of the studied videos decays very fast and most of these videos remain popular for
  only a week. Our findings reflect the most recent developments of UGC sites, which
  provide technical and commercial insights for engineers and UGC site owners.
