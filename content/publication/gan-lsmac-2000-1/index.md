abstract: 'The rapid growth of the Internet is changing the way we do business. Electronic
  Commerce (or E-Commerce) is already a reality and will expand rapidly in the near
  future. However, the success of E-Commerce depends heavily on the scalability and
  availability of the servers. Cluster-based servers using commodity hardware have
  been accepted as a good alternative to expensive specialized hardware for building
  scalable services. In this paper, we summarize the two clustering architectures:
  IP-based clustering and MAC-based clustering. A new efficient implementation of
  the MAC-based clustering architecture is presented and its performance in clustering
  Web servers was measured using the WebStone benchmark and was found to be superior
  to that of existing MAC-based clustering implementations.'
