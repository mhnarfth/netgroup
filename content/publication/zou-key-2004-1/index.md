abstract: 'In this paper, we propose two conference key management schemes for secure
  dynamic conferencing: one is a central ized scheme and the other a distributed one.
  Both schemes are based on a (key) tree structure so they are scalable and efficient.
  Moreover, both schemes allow highly group dynamics.'
