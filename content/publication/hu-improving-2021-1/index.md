abstract: Network service mesh architectures, by interconnecting cloud clusters, provide
  access to services across distributed infrastructures. Typically, services are replicated
  across clusters to ensure resilience. However, end-to-end service performance varies
  mainly depending on the service loads experienced by individual clusters. Therefore,
  a key challenge is to optimize end-to-end service performance by routing service
  requests to clusters with the least service processing/response times. We present
  a two-phase approach that combines an optimized multi-layer optical routing system
  with service mesh performance costs to improve end-to-end service performance. Our
  experimental strategy shows that leveraging a multi-layer architecture in combination
  with service performance information improves end-to-end performance. We evaluate
  our approach by testing our strategy on a service mesh layer overlay on a modified
  continental united states (CONUS) network topology.
