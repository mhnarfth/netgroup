abstract: The survivable virtual topology routing problem is to route a virtual topology
  graph on a optical fiber physical topology such that the virtual topology remains
  connected when failures occur in the physical topology. In this work we study the
  problem of survivable virtual topology routing under single node/SRLG (Shared Risk
  Link Group) failure model. We prove that the survivable virtual topology routing
  problem under node/SRLG failures is NP-complete. We present an improved integer
  linear programming (ILP) formulation for computing the survivable routing of a virtual
  topology graph. However, ILP is not scalable when the network size scales more than
  a few tens of nodes. In this work, we present sub-classes of graphs which more accurately
  model an actual network and for which a survivable routing can be easily computed
  solving an ILP. We successfully computed the survivable routing of virtual topologies
  belonging to these sub-classes against link/SRLG failures for topologies of size
  up to 24 nodes.
