abstract: As the popularity of software defined networks (SDN) and OpenFlow increases,
  policy-driven network management has received more attention. Manual configuration
  of multiple devices is being replaced by an automated approach where a software-based,
  network-aware controller handles the configuration of all network devices. Software
  applications running on top of the network controller provide an abstraction of
  the topology and facilitate the task of operating the network. We propose OpenSec,
  an OpenFlow-based security framework that allows a network security operator to
  create and implement security policies written in human-readable language. Using
  OpenSec, the user can describe a flow in terms of OpenFlow matching fields, define
  which security services must be applied to that flow (deep packet inspection, intrusion
  detection, spam detection, etc) and specify security levels that define how OpenSec
  reacts if malicious traffic is detected. We implement OpenSec in the GENI testbed
  to evaluate the flexibility, accuracy and scalability of the framework. The experimental
  setup includes deep packet inspection, intrusion detection and network quarantining
  to secure a web server from network scanners. We achieve a constant delay when reacting
  to security alerts and a detection rate of 98%.
