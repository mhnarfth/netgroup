abstract: This paper proposes an alternate approach to fully transparent and fully
  opaque optical networks for operating a wavelength routed optical network. The architecture
  of the regeneration node that performs sparse regeneration (or translucency) is
  discussed. The regeneration demands generated from call blocking and signal quality
  requirements are addressed. Two implementation strategies for incorporating sparse
  regeneration are introduced and their relative merits are studied.
