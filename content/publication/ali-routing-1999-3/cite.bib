 abstract = {Routing and wavelength assignment (RWA) is an important problem that arises in wavelength division multiplexed (WDM) optical networks. Previous studies have solved many variations of this problem under the assumption of perfect conditions regarding the power of a signal. We investigate this problem while allowing for degradation of routed signals by components such as taps, multiplexers, and fiber links. We assume that optical amplifiers are preplaced. We investigate the problem of routing the maximum number of connections while maintaining proper power levels. The problem is formulated as a mixed-integer nonlinear program and two-phase hybrid solution approaches employing two different heuristics are developed.},
