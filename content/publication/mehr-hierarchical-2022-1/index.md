abstract: A centralized Software-defined Network (SDN) controller, due to its nature,
  faces many issues such as a single point of failure, computational complexity growth,
  different types of attacks, reliability challenges and scalability concerns. One
  of the most common fifth generation cyber-attacks is the Distributed Denial of Service
  (DDoS) attack. Having a single SDN controller can lead to a plethora of issues with
  respect to latency, computational complexity in the control plane, reachability,
  and scalability as the network scale increases. To address these issues, state-of-the-art
  approaches have investigated multiple SDN controllers in the network. The placement
  of these multiple controllers has drawn more attention in recent studies. In our
  previous work, we evaluated an Entropy-based technique and a machine learning-based
  Support Vector Machine (SVM) to detect DDoS using a single SDN controller. In this
  paper, we extend our previous work to further decrease the impact of the DDoS attacks
  on the SDN controller. Our new technique called Hierarchical Classic Controllers
  (HCC) uses SVM and Entropy methods to detect abnormal traffic which can lead to
  network failures caused by overwhelming a single controller. Determining the number
  of controllers and their best placement are major contributions in our new method.
  Our results show that the combination of the above three methods (HCC with SVM and
  Entropy), in the case of a network with 3 controllers provides greater accuracy
  and improves the DDoS attack detection rate to 86.12% compared to 79.03% and 81.33%
  using Entropy-based HCC and SVM-based HCC, respectively.
