abstract: Data transfer in wide-area networks has been long studied in different contexts,
  from data sharing among data centers to online access to scientific data. Many software
  tools and platforms have been developed to facilitate easy, reliable, fast, and
  secure data transfer over wide area networks, such as GridFTP, FDT, bbcp, mdtmFTP,
  and XDD. However, few studies have shown the full capabilities of existing data
  transfer tools from the perspective of whether such tools have fully adopted state-of-the-art
  techniques through meticulous comparative evaluations. In this paper, we evaluate
  the performance of the four highperformance data transfer tools (GridFTP, FDT, mdtmFTP,
  and XDD) in various environments. Our evaluation suggests that each tool has strengths
  and weaknesses. FDT and GridFTP perform consistently in diverse environments. XDD
  and mdtmFTP show improved performance in limited environments and datasets during
  our evaluation. Unlike other studies on data transfer tools, we also evaluate the
  predictability of the toolsâ€™ performance, an important factor for scheduling different
  stages of science workflows. Performance predictability also helps in (auto)tuning
  the configurable parameters of the data transfer tool. We apply statistical learning
  techniques such as linear/polynomial regression, and k-nearest neighbors (kNN),
  to assess the performance predictability of each tool using its control parameters.
  Our results show that we can achieve good prediction performance for GridFTP and
  mdtmFTP using linear regression and kNN, respectively.
