abstract: Most of the proposed key management protocols for wireless sensor networks
  (WSNs) in the literature assume that a single base station is used and that the
  base station is trustworthy. However, there are applications in which multiple base
  stations are used and the security of the base stations must be considered. This
  paper investigates a key management protocol in wireless sensor networks which include
  multiple base stations. We consider the situations in which both the base stations
  and the sensor nodes can be compromised. The proposed key management protocol, mKeying,
  includes two schemes, a key distribution scheme, mKeyDist, supporting multiple base
  stations in the network, and a key revocation scheme, mKeyRev, used to efficiently
  remove the compromised nodes from the network. Our analyses show that the proposed
  protocol is efficient and secure against the compromise of the base stations and
  the sensor nodes.
