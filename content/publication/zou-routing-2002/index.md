abstract: Routing (and forwarding) is a core problem in networks for delivering data
  from one node to another. Today wireless networks are becoming popular because of
  their “3 Anys”–Any person, Anywhere and Any time. Wireless ad hoc networks are termed
  as mobile distributed multihop wireless networks without predetermined topology
  (preexisting fixed infrastructure) or central control. In this paper, we present
  a comprehensive review for routing features and techniques in wireless ad hoc networks.
  For more than a dozen typical existing routing protocols, we compare their properties
  according to different criteria, and categorize them according to their routing
  strategies and relationships.
