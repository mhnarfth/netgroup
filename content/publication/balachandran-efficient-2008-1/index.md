abstract: As a result of the growing popularity of wireless networks, in particular
  mobile ad hoc networks (MANET), security over such networks has become very important.
  Trust establishment, key management, authentication, and authorization are important
  areas that need to be thoroughly researched before security in MANETs becomes a
  reality. This work studies the problem of secure group communications (SGCs) and
  key management over MANETs. It identifies the key features of any SGC scheme over
  such networks. AUTH-CRTDH, an efficient key agreement scheme with authentication
  capability for SGC over MANETs, is proposed. Compared to the existing schemes, the
  proposed scheme has many desirable features such as contributory and efficient computation
  of group key, uniform work load for all members, few rounds of rekeying, efficient
  support for user dynamics, key agreement without member serialization and defense
  against the Man-in-the-Middle attack, and the Least Common Multiple (LCM) attack.
  These properties make the proposed scheme well suited for MANETs. The implementation
  results show that the proposed scheme is computationally efficient and scales well
  to a large number of mobile users. Copyright © 2007 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.
