abstract: The bandwidth requirements of the Internet are increasing every day and
  there are newer and more bandwidth-thirsty applications emerging on the horizon.
  Wavelength division multiplexing (WDM) is the next step towards leveraging the capabilities
  of the optical fiber, especially for wide-area backbone networks. The ability to
  switch a signal at intermediate nodes in a WDM network based on their wavelengths
  is known as wavelength-routing. One of the greatest advantages of using wavelength-routing
  WDM is the ability to create a virtual topology different from the physical topology
  of the underlying network. This virtual topology can be reconfigured when necessary,
  to improve performance. We discuss the previous work done on virtual topology design
  and also discuss and propose different reconfiguration algorithms applicable under
  different scenarios.
