abstract: Network anomaly detection systems can be used to identify anomalous transfers
  or threats, which, when undetected, can trigger large-scale malicious events. Data-intensive
  science projects rely on high-throughput computing and high-speed networking resources
  for data analysis and processing. In this paper, we propose an anomaly detection
  framework and architecture for identifying anomalies in GridFTP transfers. Application-awareness
  plays an important role in our proposed architecture and is used to communicate
  GridFTP application metadata to the machine learning and anomaly detection system.
  We demonstrate the effectiveness of our architecture by evaluating the framework
  with a real-world, large-scale dataset of GridFTP transfers. Preliminary results
  show that our framework can be used to develop novel anomaly detection services
  with diverse feature sets for distributed and data-intensive projects.
