abstract: Today, many leading organizations are undertaking extensive research on
  a very broad range of new and evolving optical networking technologies. These efforts
  carry particular significance, especially in light of the “postbubble” dynamics
  of the optical networking market and have led to the investigation of various cost-efficient
  optical technologies. Today’s telecom carriers operate several independent optical
  domains based on diverse technologies, control solutions, standards, and protocols,
  making interdomain and intercarrier interworking extremely difficult. Standardized
  interworking across diverse multigranularity network interfaces, and interoperability
  across disparate vendor equipments and carrier domains are crucial to provisioning
  end-to-end services and achieving cost-efficient network operation. Needless to
  say, having an interoperable and standard control plane across multidomain optical
  networks can benefit carriers through the availability of a wide selection of network
  elements, platforms, and multiple vendor solutions resulting in faster deployment
  and reduced CAPEX and OPEX charges.
