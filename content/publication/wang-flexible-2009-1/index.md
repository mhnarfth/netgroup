abstract: Multi-view peer-to-peer (P2P) live streaming systems have recently emerged,
  where a user can simultaneously watch multiple channels. Previous work on multi-view
  P2P streaming solves the fundamental inter-channel bandwidth competition problem
  at the individual peer level, and thus can be used with very limited types of streaming
  protocols. In this paper, we propose a new protocol for multi-view P2P streaming,
  called divide-and-conquer (DAC), which efficiently solves the inter-channel bandwidth
  competition problem using a divide-and conquer strategy at the channel level, and
  thus is flexible to work with various streaming protocols. This makes DAC more suitable
  for upgrading current single-view P2P live streaming systems to multi-view P2P live
  streaming systems. Our extensive packetlevel simulations show that DAC is efficient
  in allocating the overall system bandwidth among competing channels, is flexible
  in working with various streaming protocols, and is scalable in supporting a large
  number of users and channels.
