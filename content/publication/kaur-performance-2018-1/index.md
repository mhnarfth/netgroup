abstract: In today’s global IP traffic trend, there are various service types that
  differ based on users’ demands and technologies deployed in different regions. Besides
  real time entertainment services, there is also a rapid increase in demand to deliver
  best-effort services such as voice over internet protocol (VoIP), offline viewing,
  file sharing, and web browsing in a cost-efficient manner. Integrated fiber-wireless
  (FiWi) broadband access networks have emerged as a promising broadband access technology
  that can provide high quality e-services to large number of distributed wireless
  subscribers. In this paper, we deal with a converged 10-Gigabit capable passive
  optical network (XG-PON) and an enhanced distributed channel access (EDCA) based
  Wi-Fi architecture that incorporates an efficient deficit dynamic bandwidth allocation
  (DBA) algorithm at the optical line terminal (OLT) to support different Quality
  of Service (QoS) needs of users efficiently. The performance evaluation of the integrated
  network is carried out in the NS-3 simulator and the results are reported in terms
  of delay and fairness index. It is observed that the performance of the integrated
  network is improved both in terms of average delay and fairness index up to a certain
  load.
