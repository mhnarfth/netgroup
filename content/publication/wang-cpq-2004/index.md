abstract: 'In this paper, we propose a Control Packet Queuing (CPQ) protocol based
  on the Just-Enough-Time (JET) protocol which can provide differentiated services
  for optical burst switching (OBS) network. Specifically, we apply OBS to support
  two traffic classes: real-time and non-real-time. Correspondingly, two priority
  queues are built for control packets in the electrical layer at the OBS nodes. All
  arriving control packets are first buffered in the queues and then scheduled using
  the bandwidth reservation algorithm, in which real-time control packets are considered
  first before non-real-time control packets in reserving bandwidth. Simulation results
  show that our proposed protocol is averagely 52.72% better than a First Come First
  Served (FCFS) protocol in guaranteeing QoS of real-time traffic when the offered
  load ratio of real-time to non-real-time is set at 1: 9.'
