abstract: Motivated by the success of the Picture in Picture feature of the traditional
  TV, several commercial Peer-to-Peer MultiMedia Streaming (P2PMMS) applications now
  support the multi-view feature, with which a user can simultaneously watch multiple
  channels on its screen. This paper considers the peer selection problem in multi-view
  P2PMMS. This problem has been well studied in the traditional single-view P2PMMS;
  however, it becomes more complicated in multi-view P2PMMS, mainly due to the fact
  that a peer watching multiple channels joins multiple corresponding overlays. In
  this paper, we propose a novel peer selection algorithm, called Channel-Aware Peer
  Selection (CAPS), where a peer selects its neighboring peers based on the channel
  subscription of the system, in order to efficiently utilize the bandwidth of all
  peers in the system, especially those peers watching multiple channels. The results
  of a large-scale simulation with 10,000 peers and 4 channels shows that CAPS can
  significantly improve the system performance over the straightforward Random Peer
  Selection (RPS), which is widely used in single-view P2PMMS networks.
