 abstract = {Server scalability is more important than ever in today's client/server dominated network environments. Recently, researchers have begun to consider cluster-based computers using commodity hardware as an alternative to expensive specialized hardware for building scalable Web servers. In this paper, we present performance results comparing two cluster-based Web servers based on different server architectures: OSI layer two dispatching (LSMAC) and OSI layer three dispatching (LSNAT). Both cluster-based server systems were implemented as application-space programs running on commodity hardware in contrast to other, similar, solutions which require specialized hardware/software. We point out the advantages and disadvantages of both systems. We also identify when servers should be clustered and when clustering will not improve performance.},
