abstract: One of the important issues in establishing a fault tolerant connection
  in a wavelength division multiplexing optical network is computing a pair of disjoint
  working and protection paths and a free wavelength along the paths. While most of
  the earlier research focused only on computing disjoint paths, in this work we consider
  computing both disjoint paths and a free wavelength along the paths. The concept
  of dependent cost structure (DCS) of protection paths to enhance their resource
  sharing ability was proposed in our earlier work. In this work we extend the concept
  of DCS of protection paths to wavelength continuous networks. We formalize the problem
  of computing disjoint paths with DCS in wavelength continuous networks and prove
  that it is NP-complete. We present an iterative heuristic that uses a layered graph
  model to compute disjoint paths with DCS and identify a free wavelength.
