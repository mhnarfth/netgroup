abstract: The emergence of Wavelength Division Multiplexing (WDM) technology provides
  the capability for increasing the bandwidth of Synchronous Optical Network (SONET)
  rings by grooming low-speed traffic streams onto different high-speed wavelength
  channels. Since the cost of SONET add-drop multiplexers (SADM) at each node dominates
  the total cost of these networks, how to assign the wavelength, groom the traffic,
  and bypass the traffic through the intermediate nodes has received a lot of attention
  from researchers recently. Moreover, the traffic pattern of the optical network
  changes from time to time. How to develop dynamic reconfiguration algorithms for
  traffic grooming is an important issue.
