abstract: Wavelength division multiplexing (WDM) offers a solution to the problem
  of exploiting the large bandwidth on optical links; it is the current favorite multiplexing
  technology for optical communication networks. Due to the high cost of an optical
  amplifier, it is desirable to strategically place the amplifiers throughout the
  network in a way that guarantees that all the signals are adequately amplified while
  minimizing the total number amplifiers being used. Previous studies all consider
  a star-based network. This paper demonstrates an original approach for solving the
  problem in switch-based WDM optical network assuming the traffic matrix is always
  the permutation of the nodes. First we formulate the problem by choosing typical
  permutations which can maximize the traffic load on individual links; then a GA
  (genetic algorithm) is used to search for feasible amplifier placements. Finally,
  by setting up all the lightpaths without violating the power constraints we confirm
  the feasibility of the solution.
