abstract: Survivable traffic grooming (STG) is a promising approach to provide reliable
  and resource-efficient multi-granularity connection services in optical networks.
  In this paper, we study the static STG problem in WDM mesh networks employing path
  protection at the lightpath level. To make connections survivable under various
  failures such as fiber cut and duct cut, we consider the general shared risk link
  group (SRLG) diverse routing constraints. In addition to providing the results from
  the integer linear programming (ILP) approach, we propose three efficient heuristics,
  namely separated grooming algorithm (SGA), integrated grooming algorithm (IGA) and
  tabu search grooming algorithm (TSGA). While SGA and IGA correspond to an overlay
  model and a peer model respectively, TSGA further improves SGA and IGA by incorporating
  the tabu search method. Numerical results show that the heuristics use much shorter
  running times to generate network throughputs close to those of the ILP formulations.
