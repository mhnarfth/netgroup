abstract: The security of the two party Diffie-Hellman key exchange protocol is currently
  based on the discrete logarithm problem (DLP). However, it can also be built upon
  the elliptic curve discrete logarithm problem (ECDLP). Most proposed secure group
  communication schemes employ the DLP-based Diffie-Hellman protocol. This paper proposes
  the ECDLP-based Diffie-Hellman protocols for secure group communication and evaluates
  their performance on wireless ad hoc networks. The proposed schemes are compared
  at the same security level with DLP-based group protocols under different channel
  conditions. Our experiments and analysis show that the Tree-based Group Elliptic
  Curve Diffie-Hellman (TGECDH) protocol is the best in overall performance for secure
  group communication among the four schemes discussed in the paper. Low communication
  overhead, relatively low computation load and short packets are the main reasons
  for the good performance of the TGECDH protocol.
