abstract: 'Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs) are used in many applications in military,
  ecological, and health-related areas. These applications often include the monitoring
  of sensitive information such as enemy movement on the battlefield or the location
  of personnel in a building. Security is therefore important in WSNs. However, WSNs
  suffer from many constraints, including low computation capability, small memory,
  limited energy resources, susceptibility to physical capture, and the use of insecure
  wireless communication channels. These constraints make security in WSNs a challenge.
  In this article we present a survey of security issues in WSNs. First we outline
  the constraints, security requirements, and attacks with their corresponding countermeasures
  in WSNs. We then present a holistic view of security issues. These issues are classified
  into five categories: cryptography, key management, secure routing, secure data
  aggregation, and intrusion detection. Along the way we highlight the advantages
  and disadvantages of various WSN security protocols and further compare and evaluate
  these protocols based on each of these five categories. We also point out the open
  research issues in each subarea and conclude with possible future research directions
  on security in WSNs.'
