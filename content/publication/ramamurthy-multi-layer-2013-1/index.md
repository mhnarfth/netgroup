abstract: To address the reliability challenges due to failures and planned outages,
  Internet Service Providers (ISPs) typically use two backbone routers at each central
  office to which access routers connected in a dual-homed configuration. At the IP
  layer, redundant backbone routers and redundant transport equipment to interconnect
  them are deployed, providing reliability through node and path diversity. However,
  adding such redundant resources increases the overall cost of the network. Hence,
  a fundamental redesign of the backbone network avoiding such redundant resources,
  by leveraging the capabilities of an agile optical transport network, is highly
  desired. In this paper, we propose such a fundamental redesign of IP backbones.
  Our alternative design uses only a single router at each office but uses the agile
  optical transport layer to carry traffic to remote Backbone Routers (BRs) in order
  to survive failures or outages of the single local BR. Optimal mapping of local
  Access Routers (ARs) to remote BRs is determined by solving an Integer Linear Program
  (ILP). We describe how our proposed design can be realized using current optical
  transport technology. We evaluate network designs for cost and performability, the
  latter being a metric combining performance and availability. We show significant
  reduction in cost for approximately the same level of reliability as current designs.
