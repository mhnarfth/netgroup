abstract: 'Network planners are often requested to provision multiple physically-diverse
  high-speed circuits over a large carrier’s core (inter-city) DWDM network, which
  consists of multiple layers and heterogeneous vendor systems. Optimally provisioning
  such circuits while avoiding shared risk link group (SRLG) failures is an NP-hard
  problem. In this paper, we propose a novel and practical two-step approach: pre-processing
  with Integer Linear Programming (ILP) for absolutely or maximally SRLG-diverse routes
  and post-processing for DWDM system selection, regenerator placement and wavelength
  assignment. This approach has been implemented in a production network planning
  tool. According to our experiments, for a typical large carrier’s core optical network,
  most of the diverse-routing demands can be solved within 1min, even with tens of
  thousands of binary decision variables, which allows interactive use by network
  planners.'
