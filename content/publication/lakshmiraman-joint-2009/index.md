abstract: Data-intensive grid applications require huge data transfers between grid
  computing nodes. These computing nodes, where computing jobs are executed, are usually
  geographically separated. A grid network that employs optical wavelength division
  multiplexing (WDM) technology and optical switches to interconnect computing resources
  with dynamically provisioned multigigabit rate bandwidth lightpath is called a lambda
  grid network. A computing task may be executed on any one of several computing nodes
  which possesses the necessary resources. In order to reflect the reality in job
  scheduling, allocation of network resources for data transfer should be taken into
  consideration. However, few scheduling methods consider the communication contention
  on lambda grids. In this paper, we investigate the joint scheduling problem while
  considering both optical network and computing resources in a lambda grid network.
  The objective of our work is to maximize the total number of jobs that can be scheduled
  in a lambda grid network. An adaptive routing algorithm is proposed and implemented
  for accomplishing the communication tasks for every job submitted in the network.
  Four heuristics (FIFO, ESTF, LJF, RS) are implemented for job scheduling of the
  computational tasks. Simulation results prove the feasibility and efficiency of
  the proposed solution.
