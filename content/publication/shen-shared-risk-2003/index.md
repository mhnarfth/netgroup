abstract: 'The static provisioning problem in wavelength-routed optical networks has
  been studied for many years. However, service providers are still facing the challenges
  arising from the special requirements for provisioning services at the optical layer.
  In this paper, we incorporate some realistic constraints into the static provisioning
  problem, and formulate it under different network resource availability conditions.
  We consider three classes of shared risk link group (SRLG)-diverse path protection
  schemes: dedicated, shared, and unprotected. We associate with each connection request
  a lightpath length constraint and a revenue value. When the network resources are
  not sufficient to accommodate all the connection requests, the static provisioning
  problem is formulated as a revenue maximization problem, whose objective is maximizing
  the total revenue value. When the network has sufficient resources, the problem
  becomes a capacity minimization problem with the objective of minimizing the number
  of used wavelength-links. We give integer linear programming (ILP) formulations
  for these problems. Because solving these ILP problems is extremely time consuming,
  we propose a tabu search heuristic to solve these problems within a reasonable time.
  Experimental results are presented to compare the solutions obtained by an ILP solver,
  the tabu search heuristic and a divide-and-conquer greedy heuristic.'
