abstract: Several recent Internet measurement studies show that the higher the packet
  sending rate, the higher the packet-reordering probability. This implies that recently
  proposed high-speed TCP variants are more likely to experience packet reordering
  than regular TCP in high-speed networks, since they are designed to achieve much
  higher throughput than regular TCP in these networks. In this paper, we first study
  the characteristics of packet reordering in high speed networks. Second, we verify
  the impact of packet reordering on high speed TCP variants and evaluate the effectiveness
  of the existing reordering-tolerant TCP enhancements using simulations. Our simulation
  results demonstrate that high-speed TCP variants perform poorly in the presence
  of packet reordering, and existing reordering-tolerant algorithms can significantly
  improve the performance of high-speed TCP variants.
