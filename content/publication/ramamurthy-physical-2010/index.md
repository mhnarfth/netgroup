abstract: This paper describes the application of physics based simulation techniques
  to the risk analysis and risk informed design of liquid propellant rocket engines
  used on space launch vehicles. Understanding the operational and failure behavior
  of crewed space launcher propulsion systems is critical to the characterization
  of integrated vehicle risk. The analysis of threats posed by the failure of these
  systems to the mission, vehicle and crew is informed by a study of off-nominal behavior.
  To better answer questions on the failure behavior of rocket engines, it is essential
  to study the underlying physics. To this end, the development of simulation tools
  to aid the risk analyst in the study of system level behavior is elucidated. ROCETS
  (ROCket Engine Transient Simulator) simulation code was used to investigate the
  steady state and transient physical behavior of cryogenic rocket engines for nominal
  and off-nominal operating conditions. Insights obtained from the application of
  this methodology are discussed.
