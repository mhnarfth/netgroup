abstract: 'The Interplanetary Network (IPN) or the Interplanetary Internet is a network
  composed of interconnected space objects, which are in turn connected to mission
  control stations on the surface of Earth. The IPN is our only portal to the deep
  space, and yet it has been relatively sparse, until recently. With the ongoing and
  the planned missions to the outer space, the Delay Tolerant Networking (DTN) based
  network infrastructure will require more scalable routing and scheduling algorithms.
  In this paper, we propose the first Mixed Integer Linear Programming (MILP) model
  for message routing and scheduling in the IPN using Multi-Attribute Decision Making
  (MADM) principles. Based on this model, we propose a novel MADM-based algorithm
  called Multi-Attribute Routing and Scheduling (MARS) algorithm. This algorithm uses
  a sliding window of size n to schedule the first n messages in the buffer based
  on multiple attributes. After finding the optimal schedule for these messages (in
  terms of delivery rate), they are routed using our proposed Dijkstra-based routing
  algorithm. We use an existing MADM technique, PROMETHEE II, and consider the four
  main attributes of a message: size, priority, time to live (TTL), and time in buffer
  (TiB). Finally, we run multiple simulation experiments in order to test the performance
  of the proposed MARS and show that MADM coupled with scheduling and routing in IPN
  delivers at least three times more messages than a previously proposed technique,
  the Contact Graph Routing (CGR), while significantly reducing the average end-to-end
  delay and overhead.'
