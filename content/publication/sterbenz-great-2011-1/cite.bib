 abstract = {The Great Plains Environment for Network Innovation â€“ GpENI is an international programmable network testbed centered on a regional optical network in the Midwest US, providing flexible infrastructure across the entire protocol stack. The goal of GpENI is to build a collaborative research infrastructure enabling the community to conduct experiments in future Internet architecture. GpENI is funded in part by the US National Science Foundation GENI (Global Environments for Network Innovation) program and by the EU FIRE (Future Internet Research and Experimentation) Programme, and is affiliated with a project funded by the NSF FIND (Future Internet Design) Program.},
