abstract: OpenFlow is currently the most commonly deployed Software Defined Networking
  (SDN) technology. SDN consists of decoupling the control and data planes of a network.
  A software-based controller is responsible for managing the forwarding information
  of one or more switches; the hardware only handles the forwarding of traffic according
  to the rules set by the controller. OpenFlow is an SDN technology proposed to standardize
  the way that a controller communicates with network devices in an SDN architecture.
  It was proposed to enable researchers to test new ideas in a production environment.
  OpenFlow provides a specification to migrate the control logic from a switch into
  the controller. It also defines a protocol for the communication between the controller
  and the switches. As discussed in this survey paper, OpenFlow-based architectures
  have specific capabilities that can be exploited by researchers to experiment with
  new ideas and test novel applications. These capabilities include software-based
  traffic analysis, centralized control, dynamic updating of forwarding rules and
  flow abstraction. OpenFlow-based applications have been proposed to ease the configuration
  of a network, to simplify network management and to add security features, to virtualize
  networks and data centers and to deploy mobile systems. These applications run on
  top of networking operating systems such as Nox, Beacon, Maestro, Floodlight, Trema
  or Node.Flow. Larger scale OpenFlow infrastructures have been deployed to allow
  the research community to run experiments and test their applications in more realistic
  scenarios. Also, studies have measured the performance of OpenFlow networks through
  modelling and experimentation. We describe the challenges facing the large scale
  deployment of OpenFlow-based networks and we discuss future research directions
  of this technology.
