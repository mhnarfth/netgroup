 abstract = {SIMON is an object-oriented event-driven simulation package implemented in C++ which incorporates optical device characteristics in the measurement of network-level blocking statistics. SIMON is suitable for studying the performance of large wavelength-routed optical networks, in which a call is set up in the network for a specific duration on a pre- determined lightpath. Currently the physical-layer models allow for modeling phenomena such as signal attenuation in fiber and other components, amplifier gain saturation, and homowavelength crosstalk in switches. Simulation experiments can be performed with a user-specified bit-error rate limit, which must be satisfied by any call set up in the network.},
