abstract: Content-based routing has emerged as a new routing paradigm, allowing messages
  to be routed based on defined fields within the message. Content-based routers generally
  employ XML. Each message is translated into XML when sent, and translated out of
  XML when received. Further, XML limits the objects sent to documents and messages.
  We introduce here a contentbased router that goes beyond messages to routing entire
  Java objects. The Java Object Router (JOR) separates routing mechanisms from routing
  policies, making it easy to use in a variety of applications.
