abstract: Тhe Internet is growing at a tremendous rate today. New services, such a,s
  telephony and multimedia, are being added to the pure data-delivery frame-work of
  yesterday. Such high demands on capacity (bandwidth) could lead to a “bandwidth-crunch”
  at the core wide-area network resulting in degradation of service-quality. Fortunately,
  technological innovations have emerged which can provide some relief to the end-user
  struggling with the Internet’s well-known delay and bandwidth limitations. At the
  physical layer, a complete overhaul of existing networks is envisaged from electronic
  media (such as twisted-pair and cable) to optical fibers [1]. Optical fibers employing
  the promising technique of wavelength division multiplexing (WDM) can support around
  1000 times the capacity of their electronic counterparts. WDM allows the simultaneous
  transmission of several channels on the same fiber each on a different wavelength
  (frequency) [2, 3, 4]. WDM is already being deployed in commercial point-to-point
  fiber links including undersea installations. WDM-based optical networks are currently
  being tested in the U.S. (e.g., MОNЕТ, NТONC projects) [5] and Europe (RACE, ACТS
  projects) [6].
