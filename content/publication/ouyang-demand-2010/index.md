abstract: Peer-to-peer (P2P) technology has become an attractive approach for enabling
  large-scale video streaming applications, but the factor of users' subjective preferences
  is usually ignored in such networks. As users have different demands on video quality,
  we have proposed several schemes, to address the design challenge of providing all
  users uninterrupted video with their desired qualities in case their demands change
  dynamically. However, there is still a lack of theoretical analysis of how good
  we can achieve, and what guidelines we should follow when designing schemes in case
  of demand heterogeneity. To shed more light on demand heterogeneity problem, we
  model the problem as a resource demand and supply problem. We propose an optimization
  method to improve bandwidth efficiency through efficient bandwidth allocation. We
  develop a tiered overlay and a price-rated mechanism to implement cooperation among
  peers, and present a framework to address the challenge via efficient bandwidth
  allocation and group cooperation. Through complementary simulations, we evaluate
  the effectiveness of the proposed framework, and show that it effectively helps
  existing solutions, such as the Partial Participation Scheme (PPS), achieve better
  performance.
