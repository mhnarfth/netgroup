abstract: The introduction of bring your own device (BYOD) policy in the corporate
  world creates benefits for companies as well as job satisfaction for the employee.
  However, it also creates challenges in terms of security as new vulnerabilities
  arise. In particular, these challenges include space isolation, data confidentiality,
  and policy compliance as well as handling the resource constraints of mobile devices
  and the intrusiveness created by installed applications seeking to perform BYOD
  functions. We present Remote Mobile Screen (RMS), an approach for secure BYOD environments
  that addresses all these challenges. In order to achieve this, the enterprise provides
  the employee with a trusted virtual machine running a mobile operating system, which
  is located in the enterprise network and to which the employee connects using the
  mobile BYOD device. We describe our proposed solution and discuss our experimental
  results. Finally, we discuss advantages and disadvantages of RMS and possible future
  work.
