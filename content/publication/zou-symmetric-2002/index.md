abstract: Secure Group Communications (SGC) is becoming an extremely important research
  area because of its potentially enormous application paradigms. Symmetric polynomial
  based dynamic conference scheme is a typical technique for specific SGC applications.
  In this paper, we extend the symmetric polynomial based dynamic conference scheme.
  The extended scheme will allow any subset of users of any size to form a privileged
  subgroup, allow users to join and leave dynamically, and can perform bursty operation,
  especially when multiple users leave, in a very efficient way.
