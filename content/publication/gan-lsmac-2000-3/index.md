abstract: "Server responsiveness and scalability are more important than ever in today's
  client/server dominated network environments. Researchers have begun to consider
  cluster-based computers using commodity hardware as an alternative to expensive
  specialized hardware for building scalable Web servers. In this paper, we present
  performance results comparing two cluster-based Web servers based on different server
  infrastructures: MAC-based dispatching (LSMAC) and IP-based dispatching (LSNAT).
  Both cluster-based server systems were implemented as application-space programs
  running on commodity hardware. We point out the advantages and disadvantages of
  both systems. We also identify when servers should be clustered and when clustering
  will not improve performance."
