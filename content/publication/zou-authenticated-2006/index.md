abstract: 'The growing popularity of wireless ad hoc networks has brought increasing
  attention to many security issues for such networks. A lot of research has been
  carried out in the areas of authentication and key management for such networks.
  However, due to lack of existing standards for such networks, most of the proposed
  schemes are based on different assumptions and are applicable only in specific environments.
  Recently Balachandran et al. proposed CRTDH [1], a novel key agreement scheme for
  group communications in wireless ad hoc networks. The protocol has many desirable
  properties such as efficient computation of group key and support for high dynamics.
  However, the protocol does not discuss mutual authentication among the nodes and
  hence, suffers from two kinds of attacks: man-in-the-middle attack and Least Common
  Multiple (LCM) attack. This paper identifies the problems with the current CRTDH
  scheme and discusses these attacks. AUTH-CRTDH, a modified key agreement protocol
  with authentication capability, is also presented. Results from extensive experiments
  that were run on the proposed protocol and some other key agreement protocols including
  CRTDH are also discussed. It can be observed from the experiments that the new scheme
  is comparable with the CRTDH scheme and better than many other non-authenticated
  schemes in terms of performance.'
