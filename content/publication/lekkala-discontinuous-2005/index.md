abstract: Routing techniques used in wavelength routed optical networks (WRN) do not
  give an efficient solution with waveband routed optical networks (WBN) as the objective
  of routing in WRN is to reduce the blocking probability and that in WBN is to reduce
  the number of switching ports. Routing in WBN can be divided two parts, finding
  the route and grouping the wavelength assigned into that route with some existing
  wavelengths/wavebands. In this paper, we propose a heuristic for waveband routing,
  which uses a new grouping strategy called discontinuous waveband grouping to group
  the wavelengths into a waveband. The main objective of our algorithm is to decrease
  the total number of ports required and reduce the blocking probability of the network.
  The performance of the heuristic is analyzed using simulation on a WBN with non-uniform
  wavebands
