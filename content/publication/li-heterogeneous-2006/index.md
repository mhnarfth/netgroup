abstract: Feature Issue on Waveband Switching, Routing, and GroomingAdopting waveband
  switching (WBS) in backbone wavelength division multiplexed (WDM) networks is promising
  since it can reduce the network operational cost and the call blocking probability.
  However, upgrading the existing optical switching architecture requires time and
  money. Thus heterogeneous waveband switching (HeteroWBS) architecture would be desirable
  in such a system, where some nodes can support WBS functions and some cannot. We
  study the performance of HeteroWBS networks in terms of call blocking probability
  and cost savings under dynamically arriving traffic requests. We first investigate
  the effects of optical component developments on waveband switching in WDM networks.
  Various connection managements are then listed and analyzed. Next, to assist in
  the designing of efficient WBS algorithms, an autonomous clustering-based HeteroWBS
  (AS-HeteroWBS) architecture is proposed. The AS-HeteroWBS architecture clusters
  the network into multiple autonomous systems (ASs). An AS may contain some specific
  nodes that provide WBS functions for all the nodes in the AS. Based on the architecture,
  three HeteroWBS algorithms are proposed, namely, the autonomous heterogeneous WBS
  algorithm (AS-WBS), the autonomous source-limited heterogeneous WBS algorithm (AS-S-WBS),
  and the shortest-path-based heterogeneous WBS algorithm (SH-WBS). Our simulation
  results show that the HeteroWBS algorithms can achieve optimal cost savings while
  maintaining the same network throughput compared with the algorithm without WBS.
