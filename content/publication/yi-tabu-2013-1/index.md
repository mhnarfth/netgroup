abstract: Nowadays the development of Grid/Cloud networks has accelerated to meet
  the increasing requirements for large-scale computing, storage and network capabilities
  by consumers. Therefore how to improve the resource utilization in the Grid/Cloud
  to satisfy more task requests from users is becoming important. The objective of
  our investigation in this paper is to minimize the expense the consumers incur while
  obtaining the resources they request from Grid/Cloud networks. We propose a Tabu
  search based heuristic to solve joint resource allocation and task scheduling problem
  in Grid/Cloud networks, and examine the performance of the proposed method. The
  experimental results are analyzed and compared with the Best-Fit method we proposed
  in our earlier work. The results show that the Tabu search based heuristic method
  will equal or outperform the Best-Fit heuristic, and both can achieve approximate
  optimal solutions to the corresponding MILP (Mixed Integer Linear Programming) solutions.
  In addition, compared to the Best-Fit method, the Tabu search based heuristic will
  reduce the traffic blocking rate by 4% 30% generally under different job scheduling
  policies.
