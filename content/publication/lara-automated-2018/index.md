abstract: As the deployment of software-defined networks increases, so does the manageability
  of local and wide area networks. Designing intelligent solutions that respond to
  traffic changes automatically will soon become a mandatory requirement in production
  networks. In this paper, we focus on designing an intelligent control plane for
  the MobilityFirst Future Internet architecture. This architecture proposes novel
  mechanisms to replace the Internet Protocol to better support content delivery and
  mobility, such as hop-by-hop transfer, storage-aware routing and separation of identifiers
  and network addresses. In earlier work, we have argued that these mechanisms can
  be bypassed for certain data flows. Indeed, when there is no mobility involved,
  it is more convenient to implement cut-through switching at lower layers to bypass
  the routing mechanisms. In this paper, we propose an inter-domain framework capable
  of cut-through switching in MobilityFirst. The proposed framework is capable of
  adding and removing flows from tunnels automatically. It is also capable of creating
  inter-domain tunnels based on flow behavior and inter-domain latency. Our implementation
  experiments show that the control plane delay can be reduced by 75% when using inter-domain
  tunnels. Furthermore, the results also show how our framework needs fewer messages
  than current protocols such as label distribution protocol to setup intra-domain
  and inter-domain tunnels.
