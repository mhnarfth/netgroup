abstract: Research and development on optical wavelength division multiplexed (WDM)
  networkshave matured considerably over the past few years, and a number of experimental
  prototypes have been deployed and are being tested in the U.S., Europe, and Japan.
  It is anticipated that the next generation of the Internet will employ WDM-based
  optical backbones.
