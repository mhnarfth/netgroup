abstract: Resource allocation is an important component of many Cloud computing and
  datacenter management problems. For infrastructure as a service(IaaS) in the Cloud,
  the Cloud service provider allocates computing resources such as processor, memory,
  and storage. In addition to the computing infrastructures, the Cloud service provider
  in the future would also allocate bandwidth for some applications that require guaranteed
  bandwidth service to transmit a large amount of data. This type of guaranteed bandwidth
  service can be provided by provisioning a distinct connection from end-to-end, e.g.,
  by provisioning wavelength(s) in a wavelength division multiplexed wavelength routed
  network. In this paper, we focus on interdatacenter network-aware optimal resource
  allocation in the Cloud from the customer's perspective. We develop a mixed integer
  linear programming (MILP) optimal mathematical model and heuristics (Best-Fit and
  Tabu search) to solve the budget optimized joint-resource allocation problem to
  minimize the rental cost for each customer. The experimental results show that our
  heuristics can achieve an approximate optimal solution to the MILP solution and
  can reduce the customer's rental cost by at least 30%. The Best-Fit heuristic with
  shortest job execution time first and simplest job structure first (SSF) scheduling
  policies have a better performance in terms of the traffic blocking rate. The traffic
  blocking rates under both scheduling policies are 5-25% less than other policies.
  The Tabu search-based heuristic with SSF job scheduling policy has a better performance
  in terms of the traffic blocking rate than other job scheduling policies. In addition,
  the Tabu search-based heuristic also reduces the blocking rate by 4-30% compared
  with the Best-Fit heuristic under any job scheduling policy.
