Dr. Byrav Ramamurthy has secured a significant grant from the National Science Foundation (NSF) for his project, "Integrating Physical and Network Layers in the Design of Multi-Core Coherent Optical WDM Networks."

This groundbreaking research aims to advance our understanding of multi-core coherent optical communication networks by integrating high-fidelity physical layer models with efficient network layer algorithms, informed by lab and field measurements. The project, in collaboration with the Indian Institute of Technology - Madras (IITM), will focus on improving optical networking technologies by bridging the gap between physical and network layers.

## **Key objectives of the project include:**

**Optical Phase Conjugation Implementation:** Demonstrating the feasibility of Optical Phase Conjugators in a field testbed and incorporating physical layer models into network simulations.
**Space Division Multiplexing (SDM):** Implementing SDM in four-core fibers in a lab environment and integrating these models into network layer simulations.
**Resource Allocation Algorithms:** Developing efficient resource allocation algorithms for multi-core networks, exploring both direct and coherent detection mechanisms, and optical phase conjugation techniques.

This research promises to transform optical networking design and planning by incorporating physical layer characteristics like signal degradation, noise, and interference into network simulations. These enhancements will significantly improve performance metrics such as throughput, latency, and reliability, ensuring efficient resource utilization in modern telecommunication systems.

The project is part of NSF's mission to support innovative research with substantial intellectual merit and broader impacts, recognizing Dr. Ramamurthy's leadership in advancing optical networking technologies.
