abstract: 'Named Data Networking (NDN) is one of the promising future internet architectures,
  which focuses on the data rather than its location (IP/host-based system). NDN has
  several characteristics which facilitate addressing and routing the data: fail-over,
  in-network caching and load balancing. This makes it useful in areas such as managing
  scientific data. The CMS experiment on the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) has a data
  access problem amenable to content-centric networking. CERN Virtual Machine File
  System (CVMFS) is used by High Energy Physics (HEP) community for worldwide software
  distribution. CVMFS maintain its data by using content-addressable storage, which
  makes it suitable for NDN. n this paper, we investigate the possibilities of using
  a content-centric networking architecture such as NDN on distributing CMS software.'
