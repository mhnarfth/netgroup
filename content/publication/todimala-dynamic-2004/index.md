abstract: With the increasing popularity of bandwidth-intensive applications, network
  traffic has been growing exponentially. Wavelength Division Multiplexing (WDM) is
  a technique that can harness the huge bandwidth available in an optical fiber to
  satisfy the network demand. Due to the multiplicity of the connections on any single
  link, fault tolerance is of utmost importance in such WDM networks. Active research
  on providing fault tolerance in WDM networks in recent times underscores its significance.
  In this study, a dynamic partitioning protection routing technique for routing a
  Fault Tolerant Path Set (FTPS) in a network is proposed. Wavelength assignment schemes
  to this FTPS with backup multiplexing technique for networks with no wavelength
  conversion and full wavelength conversion are discussed. Performance is measured
  in terms of blocking probability and time to recover the failed connections. Our
  simulations show that this protection technique performs better than other proposed
  techniques.
