abstract: Data-driven (or swarming based) streaming is one of the popular ways to
  distribute live multimedia streaming traffic over peer-to-peer (P2P) networks. The
  efficiency and user satisfaction highly depend on the constructed overlays. The
  common neighbor selection algorithms in existing overlay construction schemes usually
  randomly select a fixed number of neighbors which satisfy the selection requirements,
  such as end-to-end delay or a peerpsilas sojourn time. However, this fixed random
  neighbor-selection algorithm (FRNS) neglects the peerspsila upload bandwidth heterogeneity
  and therefore, the upload bandwidth cannot be efficiently used. In this paper, we
  propose a variable random neighbor-selection (VRNS) scheme to alleviate the problems
  due to bandwidth heterogeneity, and in which the number of neighbors with different
  upload bandwidths is dynamically determined by the statistical bandwidth information
  of the system. Our proposed scheme is shown to outperform FRNS based upon a large
  volume of carefully designed simulations.
