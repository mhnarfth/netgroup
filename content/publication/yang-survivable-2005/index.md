abstract: This paper addresses the problem of survivable lightpath provisioning in
  wavelength-division-multiplexing (WDM) mesh networks, taking into consideration
  optical-layer protection and some realistic optical signal quality constraints.
  The investigated networks use sparsely placed optical-electrical-optical (O/E/O)
  modules for regeneration and wavelength conversion. Given a fixed network topology
  with a number of sparsely placed O/E/O modules and a set of connection requests,
  a pair of link-disjoint lightpaths is established for each connection. Due to physical
  impairments and wavelength continuity,both the working and protection lightpaths
  need to be regenerated at some intermediate nodes to overcome signal quality degradation
  and wavelength contention. In the present paper, resource-efficient provisioning
  solutions are achieved with the objective of maximizing resource sharing. The authors
  propose a resource-sharing scheme that supports three kinds of resource-sharing
  scenarios, including a conventional wavelength-link sharing scenario, which shares
  wavelength links between protection lightpaths, and two new scenarios, which share
  O/E/O modules between protection lightpaths and between working and protection lightpaths.
  An integer linear programming (ILP)-based solution approach is used to find optimal
  solutions. The authors also propose a local optimization heuristic approach and
  a tabu search heuristic approach to solve this problem for real-world,large mesh
  networks. Numerical results show that our solution approaches work well under a
  variety of network settings and achieves a high level of resource-sharing rates
  (over 60% for O/E/O modules and over 30% for wavelength links), which translate
  into great savings in network costs.
