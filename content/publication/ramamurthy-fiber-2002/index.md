abstract: The success of optical WDM networks depends heavily on the available optical
  device technology. This chapter is intended as an introduction to some of the optical
  device issues in WDM networks. It discusses the basic principles of optical transmission
  in fiber, and reviews the current state of the art in optical device technology.
