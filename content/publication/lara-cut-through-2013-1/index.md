abstract: Mobile devices are expected to become the Internet's predominant technology.
  Current protocols such as TCP/IP were not originally designed with mobility as a
  key consideration, and therefore underperform under challenging mobile and wireless
  conditions. MobilityFirst, a clean slate architecture proposal, embraces several
  key concepts centered around secure identifiers that inherently support mobility
  and trustworthiness as key requirements of the network architecture. This includes
  a hop-by-hop segmented data transport that allows late and dynamic rebinding of
  endpoint addresses to support mobility. While this provides critical gains in wireless
  segments, some overheads are incurred even in stable segments such as in the core.
  Bypassing layer 3 decisions in these cases, with lower layer cut through forwarding,
  can improve said gains. In this work, we introduce a general bypass capability within
  the MobilityFirst architecture that could provide both better performance and enable
  both individual and aggregate flow-level traffic control. Furthermore, we present
  a detailed OpenFlow-based design to bypass layer 3 routing in MobilityFirst, using
  layer 2 VLAN tagging. Finally, we present a prototype that shows that it is possible
  to use OpenFlow to create the bypass.
