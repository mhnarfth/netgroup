abstract: Supporting end-to-end real-time communication is important for wireless
  sensor networks (WSNs) to acomplish the collaborative sensing tasks with specific
  timing constraints. However, without considering the unique constraints for WSNs,
  many existing real-time communication protocols prove to be infeasible for low-cost
  WSNs. In this paper, we propose a novel real-time communication scheme (RCS) to
  provide service-differentiated soft real-time guarantees for end-to-end communication
  in WSNs. We use hop-based geographic grouping to enable location awareness for sensor
  nodes with extremely low control overhead.We use dynamic forwarding with load-balanced
  receiver contention to provide a light-weight, yet efficient, routing technique,
  which can be easily adapted for duty cycle design. We use polling contention period
  based real-time MAC support to improve the service-differentiation granularity with
  better bandwidth utilization. The performance evaluation shows that our scheme can
  achieve low end-to-end latency, high on-time delivery ratio, fine services-differentiation
  granularity with load-balance for real-time traffic in unsynchronized low-cost WSNs.
