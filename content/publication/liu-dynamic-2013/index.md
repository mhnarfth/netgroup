abstract: In this paper, we propose two distributed local-optimized algorithms (FLHT
  and DLHT), which can dynamically adjust the number of active sublinks, to save power
  consumption in the core network for both bin packing and load-balancing cases. A
  series of experiments were conducted on an Internet2 based synthetic network for
  both cases. The experiment results show that our FLHT and DLHT algorithms can achieve
  high energy savings without substantial data loss.
