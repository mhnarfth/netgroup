abstract: Healthcare interventions enable healthcare providers to monitor vital parameters
  of their patients and instruct them to make changes in their daily routine to ensure
  a healthy life. Mobile phones and cloud computing offer new opportunities to improve
  the technologies used for healthcare interventions. We propose a system (MHealthInt
  [1]) that focuses on healthcare intervention and utilizes the existing features
  of a smart phone to make the intervention process more efficient. We use Google
  Cloud Messaging (GCM) to deliver the intervention. We automate the intervention
  process, wherein a provider can schedule the intervention messages at any time of
  the day/week across intervention and control groups. We conducted a feasibility
  study involving providers and have documented the results. The study lasted a week
  and was found to be an improvement over a previous study that was conducted using
  SMS/text messages.
