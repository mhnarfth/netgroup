abstract: With the increasing popularity of bandwidth-intensive applications, network
  traffic has been growing exponentially. Wavelength Division Multiplexing (WDM) is
  a technique that can harness the huge bandwidth available in an optical fiber to
  satisfy the network demand. Due to the multiplicity of the connections on any single
  link, fault tolerance is of utmost importance in such WDM networks. Active research
  on providing fault tolerance in WDM networks in recent times underscores its significance.
  In this study, a comprehensive classification of fault-tolerant protection routing
  techniques is presented. A dynamic partitioning sub-path protection routing technique
  for routing a Fault Tolerant Path Set (FTPS) in a network is proposed. Wavelength
  assignment scheme to this FTPS based on backup multiplexing technique is discussed.
  Performance is measured in terms of blocking probability and network-wide average
  and maximum down-time of the failed connections. Our simulations show that this
  protection technique outperforms other proposed techniques.
