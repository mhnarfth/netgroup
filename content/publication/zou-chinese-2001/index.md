abstract: 'Secure group communication with hierarchical access control refers to a
  scenario where a group of members is divided into a number of subgroups located
  at different privilege levels and a high-level subgroup can receive and decrypt
  messages within any of its descendant lower-level subgroups; but the converse is
  not allowed. In this paper, we propose a new scheme CRTHACS, which is based on the
  Chinese Remainder Theorem. The scheme not only enables secure hierarchical control
  but also provides the following properties: hiding of hierarchy and receivers, authentication
  of both senders and messages, and a mechanism for the receiver to directly derive
  the key of a message.'
