abstract: Involving optical networking in the data center network (DCN) architecture
  is an emerging trend. Optical networking with advantages of high capacity and cost
  efficiency, would improve the network throughput for the cloud platform and improve
  the performance for serving big data applications. How to realize the network-aware
  resource provisioning for the big data applications in the optical DCN architecture
  would be an important issue that needs to be investigated. In this work, we focus
  on the network-aware resource provisioning in data center with different optical
  DCN architectures. Our target is to make use of limited computing and network resources
  in the data center to serve the maximum number of applications with minimal total
  cost. Optical networking is used to provide the guaranteed network bandwidth required
  by the applications. Mixed integer linear/quadratic programming (MILP/MIQP) optimization
  models are developed to solve the network-aware resource provisioning problem in
  the optical data center based on different types of DCN architectures.
