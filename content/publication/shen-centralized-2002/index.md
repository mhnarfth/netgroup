abstract: Centralized and distributed methods are two connection management schemes
  in wavelength convertible optical networks. In the earlier work, the centralized
  scheme is said to have lower network blocking probability than the distributed one.
  Hence, much of the previous work in connection management has focused on the comparison
  of different algorithms in only distributed scheme or in only centralized scheme.
  However, we believe that the network blocking probability of these two connection
  management schemes depends, to a great extent, on the network traffic patterns and
  reservation times. Our simulation results reveal that the performance improvement
  (in terms of blocking probability) of the centralized method over the distributed
  method is inversely proportional to the ratio of average connection inter-arrival
  time to reservation time. After that the ratio increases beyond a threshold, those
  two connection management schemes yield almost the same blocking probability under
  the same network load. In this paper, we review the working procedure of distributed
  and centralized schemes, discuss the tradeoff between them, compare these two methods
  under different network traffic patterns via simulation and give our conclusion
  based on the simulation data.
