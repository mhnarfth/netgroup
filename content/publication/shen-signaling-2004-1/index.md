abstract: The next-generation optical transport network will evolve from point-to-point
  connectivity to mesh networking, which can provide fast and automatic provisioning
  with enhanced flexibility and survivability. Signaling is used to support connection
  setup, maintenance, and teardown in such a network. In this paper, we study the
  performance of two hop-by-hop and one parallel signaling schemes in wavelength-routed
  optical mesh networks. Based on the sequence between optical crossconnect (OXC)
  switching and signaling message processing, we classify hop-by-hop signaling into
  two types that comply with the requirements of GMPLS signaling protocols. These
  two types are forward before switching configuration (FBSC) and forward after switching
  configuration (FASC). Also, we propose a parallel signaling scheme that is different
  from the existing hop-by-hop GMPLS signaling protocols. Considering OXC architectures
  and traffic patterns, we compare the FBSC, FASC, and parallel signaling schemes
  using simulation experiments, in terms of network blocking probability and reservation
  time. The simulation data reveal that the performance of a signaling scheme depends
  on the nature of the signaling as well as the network setting (e.g., the OXC architecture
  and traffic pattern). We analyze reasons for this result and discuss tradeoffs between
  these signaling schemes. This work offers some insight into designing an efficient
  signaling protocol for wavelength-routed optical mesh networks.
