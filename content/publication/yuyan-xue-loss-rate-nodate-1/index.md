abstract: Many wireless sensor network (WSN) transport protocols proposed in recent
  studies focus on providing end-to-end reliability as in TCP. However, traditional
  end-to-end reliability is energy and time consuming for common loss-tolerant applications
  in WSNs. In this paper, we propose a Loss Tolerant Reliable (LTR) data transport
  mechanism for dynamic Event Sensing (LTRES) in WSNs. In LTRES, a reliable event
  sensing requirement at the transport layer is dynamically determined by the sink.
  A distributed source rate adaptation mechanism is designed, incorporating a loss
  rate-based lightweight congestion control mechanism, to regulate the data traffic
  injected into the network so that the reliability requirement can be satisfied.
  An equation-based fair rate control algorithm is used to improve the fairness among
  the LTRES flows sharing the congestion path. The performance evaluations show that
  LTRES can provide LTR data transport service for multiple events with short convergence
  time, low loss rate, and high overall bandwidth utilization.
