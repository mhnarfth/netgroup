abstract: We investigate waveband switching (WBS) with different grouping strategies
  in wavelength-division multiplexing (WDM) mesh networks. End-to-end waveband switching
  (ETE-WBS) and same-destination-intermediate waveband switching (SD-IT-WBS) are analyzed
  and compared in terms of blocking probability and cost savings. First, an analytical
  model for ETE-WBS is proposed to determine the network blocking probability in a
  mesh network. For SD-IT-WBS, a simple waveband switching algorithm is presented.
  An analytical model to determine the network blocking probability is proposed for
  SD-IT-WBS based on the algorithm. The analytical results are validated by comparing
  with simulation results. Both results match well and show that ETE-WBS slightly
  outperforms SD-IT-WBS in terms of blocking probability. On the other hand, simulation
  results show that SD-IT-WBS outperforms ETE-WBS in terms of cost savings.
