abstract: Translucent WDM optical networks use sparse placement of regenerators to
  overcome the impairments and wavelength contention introduced by fully transparent
  networks, and achieve a performance close to fully opaque networks with much less
  cost. Our previous study proved the feasibility of translucent networks using the
  sparse regeneration technique. We addressed the placement of regenerators based
  on static schemes allowing only fixed number of regenerators at fixed locations.
  This paper furthers the study by proposing a suite of dynamical routing schemes.
  Dynamic allocation, advertisement and discovery of regeneration resources are proposed
  to support sharing transmitters and receivers between regeneration and access functions.
  This study follows the current trend in the optical networking industry by utilizing
  the extension of IP control protocols. Dynamic routing algorithms, aware of current
  regeneration resources and link states, are designed to smartly route the connection
  requests under quality constraints. A hierarchical network model, supported by the
  MPLS-based control plane, is also proposed to provide scalability. Experiments show
  that network performance is improved without placement of extra regenerators.
