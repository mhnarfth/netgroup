abstract: 'Widely deployed peer-to-peer (P2P) live streaming systems have become a
  great challenge for Internet Service Providers as they consume a huge amount of
  bandwidth. Inspired by the fact that different users in a P2P live streaming system
  may watch the same channel with different window sizes which have different resolution
  demands, we consider the design of a P2P live-video streaming system. The design
  utilizes this fact to reduce the bandwidth consumption but still achieve satisfactory
  streaming quality. We advocate adaptive streaming: a peerâ€™s streaming rate is commensurate
  with its window size. In order to maintain satisfactory streaming quality even in
  the case when users dynamically change their window sizes, small-window users contribute
  part of their bandwidth to help large-window users. We propose the general design
  goals, and then model and formulate the design as an optimization problem. In order
  to design simple and efficient systems for dynamic window resizing, we study two
  schemes which represent two different design philosophies: a well-balanced and more
  distributed method and a supernode-based method. Specifically, a scheme called partial
  forwarding scheme (PFS) and another scheme called partial participation scheme (PPS).
  Our packet-level simulation results show that both PFS and PPS are easy to implement,
  and achieve good performance with appropriate parameter settings. Further, we also
  discuss their advantages and disadvantages, and demonstrate which scheme should
  be used in specific scenarios.'
