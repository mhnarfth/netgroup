abstract: 'A variety of DBA (Dynamic Bandwidth Allocation) and DWBA (Dynamic Wavelength
  and Bandwidth Allocation) algorithms have been proposed which are based on different
  PONs (e.g. EPON, GPON, XG-PON, 10G-EPON, etc.). But to our knowledge, no DWBA scheme
  for NG-PON2 system, with diverse customers and prioritized traffic, has been proposed
  yet. In this work, this problem is addressed and we focus on the wavelength assignment
  part, assuming that the system applies conventional DBA method described in the
  standard ITU-T G.989. Considering this assumption, we propose five different dynamic
  wavelength and bandwidth allocation (DWBA) schemes. First, mixed integer linear
  programming (MILP) models are developed to minimize the total delay of the high
  priority data. Due to the MILPâ€™s high computational complexity, heuristic algorithms
  are developed based on the MILP model insights. The five heuristics algorithms are:
  No Block-Split Heuristic (NBH), Equal Block-Split Heuristic (EBH), Priority Based
  No Block-Split Heuristic (P-NBH), Priority Based Equal Block-Split Heuristic (P-EBH),
  and Priority Based Decider Block-Split Heuristic (P-DBH). Six priority classes of
  requests are introduced with the goal of minimizing the total delay for the high
  priority data and to lessen the bandwidth wastage of the system. Finally, experiments
  for the performance evaluation of the five DWBA schemes are conducted. The results
  show that P-DBH is the most efficient among the five because this scheme offers
  the lowest delay for high priority data and the minimum bandwidth wastage for lower
  priority ones.'
