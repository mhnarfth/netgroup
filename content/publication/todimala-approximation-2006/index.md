abstract: Multicommodity flow (MF) problems have a wide variety of applications in
  areas such as VLSI circuit design, network design, etc., and are therefore very
  well studied. The fractional MF problems are polynomial time solvable while integer
  versions are NP-complete. However, exact algorithms to solve the fractional MF problems
  have high computational complexity. Therefore approximation algorithms to solve
  the fractional MF problems have been explored in the literature to reduce their
  computational complexity. Using these approximation algorithms and the randomized
  rounding technique, polynomial time approximation algorithms have been explored
  in the literature.
