abstract: All-optical networks are becoming increasingly popular for high bandwidth
  connections. With the advent of the crossconnect technology, optical connections
  can be established dynamically. Routing and wavelength assignment are important
  issues in such networks. This work focuses on the routing issue in networks. Two
  online algorithms are presented that compute a route among all feasible routes for
  a node pair based on hop length of the path and congestion in the network. Simulations
  are conducted on sample network topologies with Poisson traffic and exponential
  call holding times. Results show that shortest hop least congested routing technique
  performs better than other previous techniques in terms of blocking probability.
