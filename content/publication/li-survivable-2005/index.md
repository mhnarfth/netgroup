abstract: This paper considers the problem of dedicated path-protection in wavelength-division
  multiplexed (WDM) mesh networks with waveband switching functionality under shared
  risk link group (SRLG) constraints. Two dedicated path-protection schemes are proposed,
  namely the PBABL scheme and the MPABWL scheme. The PBABL scheme protects each working
  waveband-path through a backup waveband-path. The MPABWL scheme protects each working
  waveband-path by either a backup waveband-path or multiple backup lightpaths. Heuristic
  algorithms adopting random optimization technique are proposed for both the schemes.
  The performance of the two protection schemes is studied and compared. Simulation
  results show that both the heuristics can obtain optimum solutions and the MPABWL
  scheme leads to less switching and transmission costs than the PBABL scheme.
