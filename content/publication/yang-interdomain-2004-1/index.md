abstract: "Feature Issue on Next-Generation WDM Network Design and Routing (WDMN).
  Future home and enterprise Internet users need high-bandwidth end-to-end connections
  that have to be provisioned automatically and dynamically. We need to make optical-layer
  routing as scalable and flexible as IP routing in today's Internet to support high-end
  applications. We study the problem of interdomain dynamic wavelength routing based
  on a multidomain translucent optical network model, which allows end-to-end lightpaths
  to be set up not only across multiple routing domains but also through two network
  layers: the optical layer and the regeneration layer. In this model, a lightpath
  can traverse the domain boundary either through optical bypass (OOO) or through
  optical-electrical-optical regeneration (OEO). We propose an interdomain dynamic
  wavelength-routing scheme with modest computational complexity to address the problem
  from an algorithmic perspective. Our experimental results show that the proposed
  interdomain dynamic wavelength-routing scheme can (a) flexibly incorporate various
  cost metrics and local (or intradomain) routing schemes into a uniform interdomain
  routing framework, (b) effectively set up end-to-end lightpaths in a multidomain
  translucent network, and (c) efficiently use both optical- and regeneration-layer
  resources."
