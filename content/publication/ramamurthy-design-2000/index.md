abstract: The bandwidth requirements of the Internet are increasing every day and
  there are newer and more bandwidth-thirsty applications emerging on the horizon.
  Wavelength division multiplexing (WDM) is the next step towards leveraging the capabilities
  of the optical fiber, especially for wide-area backbone networks. Virtual private
  networks are seen as the killer applications of tomorrow, and a great amount of
  research and development effort is being channeled into finding efficient ways for
  implementing them. In our work, we introduce the notion of VPNs operating over optical
  wavelength-routed WDM backbone networks. We formulate the problem of VPN design
  over optical WDM networks as an integer linear problem. A new method to deal with
  traffic from diverse VPNs is introduced and its performance analyzed.
