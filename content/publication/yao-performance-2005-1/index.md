abstract: Sparse traffic grooming is a practical problem to be addressed in heterogeneous
  multi-vendor optical WDM networks where only some of the optical cross-connects
  (OXCs) have grooming capabilities. Such a network is called as a sparse grooming
  network. The sparse grooming problem under dynamic traffic in optical WDM mesh networks
  is a relatively unexplored problem. In this work, we propose the maximize-lightpath-sharing
  multi-hop (MLS-MH) grooming algorithm to support dynamic traffic grooming in sparse
  grooming networks. We also present an analytical model to evaluate the blocking
  performance of the MLS-MH algorithm. Simulation results show that MLS-MH outperforms
  an existing grooming algorithm, the shortest-path single-hop (SPSH) algorithm. The
  numerical results from analysis show that it matches closely with the simulation.
  The effect of the number of grooming nodes in the network on the blocking performance
  is also analyzed.
