abstract: Increasingly, campus networks manage a multitude of large-scale data transfers.
  Big data plays a pivotal role in university research and impacts domains such as
  engineering, agriculture, natural sciences, and humanities. Over the years, numerous
  solutions have been proposed to manage and secure large-scale data transfers efficiently.
  Examples consist of the inclusion of security policies at the network edge, optimized
  middlebox management, and the Science Demilitarized Zone (Science DMZ). These solutions
  either severely degrade data transfer performance or result in data flows completely
  bypassing the campus network security controls. In this paper, we present our experience
  with the design, development, and management of large-scale data transfers using
  software defined networking (SDN) and network functions virtualization (NFV). We
  also discuss the issues and challenges associated with securing large-scale data
  transfers in campus networks.
