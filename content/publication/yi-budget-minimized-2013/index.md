abstract: The need for large-scale computing, storage and network capabilities by
  the scientific or business community has resulted in the development of cloud networks.
  Grid/Clouds users are provided with IT infrastructure (servers, storage, networks,
  etc.) as services called Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS). In this case, an efficient
  resource scheduling mechanism for allocating the infrastructure resources across
  the network will improve the resource efficiency in the cloud significantly. In
  this paper, we investigate the budget optimization of joint resources (storage,
  processor and network) allocation for IaaS model in distributed Grid/Clouds from
  the consumer's perspective. We develop a Mixed Integer Linear Programming (MILP)
  formulation along with a new resource model and propose a Best-Fit heuristic algorithm
  with different job scheduling policies. Our goal is to minimize the expenditure
  for each user to obtain enough resources to execute their submitted jobs, while
  enabling the Grid/Cloud provider to accept as many job requests from the users as
  possible. Both MILP and heuristic are tested on a 10- node topology and the Google
  Datacenter topology. The results show that the heuristic method can achieve approximate
  optimal solutions to MILP; it can reduce the user expense by at least 30%. In addition,
  Best-Fit algorithm with SSF (simple job structure first) job scheduling policy has
  the lowest blocking rate, which is 5% 25% less than other job scheduling policies.
