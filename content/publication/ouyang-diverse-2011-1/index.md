abstract: 'Peer-to-Peer (P2P) technology has become an attractive approach for enabling
  large-scale video streaming applications, but the factor of usersâ€™ subjective preferences
  is not paid enough attention in such networks. As users have various demand on video
  qualities, we can provide them with video streams at different resolutions without
  impairing their satisfaction. The adaptive streaming rate technique is a promising
  method. However, in providing adaptive streaming rate services, P2P live streaming
  design faces the following challenge: how to provide all users with uninterrupted
  video with their desired qualities in case that their demand dynamically changes?
  To shed more light on this problem, we first derive a model and formulate the problem
  as a resource demand vs supply problem. Then we present a framework to address the
  challenge via efficient bandwidth allocation and group cooperation. Through comprehensive
  simulations, we evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed framework, and conclude
  that it effectively helps existing solutions, such as Partial Participation Scheme
  (PPS), achieve better performance.'
