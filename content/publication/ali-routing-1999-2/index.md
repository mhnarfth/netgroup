abstract: 'In this paper, we investigate the problem of routing connections in ail-optical
  networks while allowing for degradation of routed signals by different optical components.
  To overcome the complexity of the problem, we divide it into two parts. First, we
  solve the pure RWA problem using fixed routes for every connection. Second, power
  assignment is accomplished by either using the smallest-gain first (SGF) heuristic
  or using a genetic algorithm. Numerical examples on a wide variety of networks show
  that: (a) the number of connections established without considering the signal attenuation
  was most of the time greater than that achievable considering attenuation; and (b)
  the genetic solution quality was much better than that of SGF, especially when the
  conflict graph of the connections generated by the linear solver is denser.'
