abstract: Translucent wavelength-division multiplexing optical networks use sparse
  placement of regenerators to overcome physical impairments and wavelength contention
  introduced by fully transparent networks, and achieve a performance close to fully
  opaque networks at a much less cost. In previous studies, we addressed the placement
  of regenerators based on static schemes,allowing for only a limited number of regenerators
  at fixed locations. This paper furthers those studies by proposing a dynamic resource
  allocation and dynamic routing scheme to operate translucent networks. This scheme
  is realized through dynamically sharing regeneration resources, including transmitters,receivers,
  and electronic interfaces, between regeneration and access functions under a multidomain
  hierarchical translucent network model. An intradomain routing algorithm, which
  takes into consideration optical-layer constraints as well as dynamic allocation
  of regeneration resources, is developed to address the problem of translucent dynamic
  routing in a single routing domain. Network performance in terms of blocking probability,
  resource utilization, and running times under different resource allocation and
  routing schemes is measured through simulation experiments.
