abstract: Data-intensive science projects rely on scalable, high-performance, fault-tolerant
  protocols for transferring large-volume data over a high-bandwidth, high-delay wide
  area network (WAN). The commonly used protocol for WAN data distribution is the
  GridFTP protocol. GridFTP uses encrypted sessions for data transfers and does not
  exchange any information with the network-layer resulting in reduced flexibility
  for network management at the site-level. We propose an application-aware software-defined
  networking (SDN) approach for providing differentiated network services for high-energy
  physics projects such as Compact Muon Solenoid (CMS) and Laser Interferometer Gravitational-Wave
  Observatory (LIGO). We demonstrate a policy-driven approach for differentiating
  network traffic by exploiting application- and network-layer collaboration to achieve
  accurate accounting of resources used by each project. We implement two strategies,
  a 7-3 queuing system, and a 10-3 queuing system, and show that the 10-3 strategy
  provides an additional capacity improvement of 11.74% over the 7-3 strategy.
