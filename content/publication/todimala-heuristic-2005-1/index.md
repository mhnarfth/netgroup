abstract: Establishing a fault-tolerant connection in a network involves computation
  of diverse working and protection paths. The shared risk link group (SRLG) (J. Strand
  et al. (2001) concept is used to model several types of failure conditions such
  as link, node, fiber conduit, etc. In this work we focus on the problem of computing
  optimal SRLG/link diverse paths under shared protection. Shared protection technique
  improves network resource utilization by allowing protection paths of multiple connections
  to share resources. In this work we propose an iterative heuristic for computing
  SRLG/link diverse paths. We present a method to calculate a quantitative measure
  that provides a bounded guarantee on the optimality of the diverse paths computed
  by the heuristic. The experimental results on computing link diverse paths show
  that our proposed heuristic is efficient in terms of number of iterations required
  (time taken) to
