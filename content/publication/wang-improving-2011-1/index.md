abstract: 'Multi-view peer-to-peer (P2P) live streaming systems have recently emerged,
  where a user is allowed to simultaneously watch one or multiple channels. Previous
  work on building multi-view P2P streaming systems requires network coding in data
  block scheduling within each channel, since it solves the fundamental inter-channel
  bandwidth competition problem at the individual peer level. Therefore, it limits
  the migration from existing single-view systems to multi-view systems. In this paper,
  we propose a new protocol, called divide-and-conquer (DAC), which provides a flexible
  way of building multi-view P2P streaming systems based on existing single-view systems.
  Specifically, the DAC protocol solves the inter-channel bandwidth competition problem
  at the channel level based on a divide-and-conquer strategy. Our extensive packet
  level simulations show that our DAC protocol achieves the three design goals: flexibility,
  efficiency and scalability.'
