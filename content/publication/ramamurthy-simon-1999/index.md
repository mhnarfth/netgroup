abstract: SIMON is an object-oriented event-driven simulation package implemented
  in C++ which incorporates optical device characteristics in the measurement of network-level
  blocking statistics. SIMON is suitable for studying the performance of large wavelength-routed
  optical networks, in which a call is set up in the network for a specific duration
  on a pre- determined lightpath. Currently the physical-layer models allow for modeling
  phenomena such as signal attenuation in fiber and other components, amplifier gain
  saturation, and homowavelength crosstalk in switches. Simulation experiments can
  be performed with a user-specified bit-error rate limit, which must be satisfied
  by any call set up in the network.
