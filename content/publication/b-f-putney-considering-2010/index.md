abstract: This paper discusses the application of a cost constrained risk informed
  design paradigm to developing a crewed Mars exploration program. Parameters that
  are studied in the planning and optimization of a space program typically include
  the cost, schedule, risk and performance. The measure of success of a given space
  program architecture depends on the ability to meet certain predefined criteria
  with respect to these interdependent parameters. Large programs tend to be beset
  with cost overruns and schedule delays arising from technical risks. A notional
  model of integrated mission risk, taking into account the transient trends of hardware
  maturation is discussed. The total time taken to accomplish the first complete mission-
  from the start of the campaign to the safe return of crew to the Earth is considered
  as a metric. This model is used to investigate how risks associated with hardware,
  stemming from as yet unresolved or unrealized technical issues or defects in the
  design, impact the schedule risk. The mission end date distribution generated by
  this model and the sensitivity of the solution to different levels of initial maturity
  for the key hardware elements is discussed. Observations regarding strategic risk
  mitigation are provided on the basis of this analysis.
