abstract: Packet and optical networks are managed independently in both current carrier
  networks and data-center interconnection networks, which results in a lack of service
  agility and is a significant source of capital expenditure and operating expense
  overhead for the network operator. In our previous works, we have proposed and experimentally
  demonstrated a software-defined networking-based architecture (service-aware architecture)
  for converged control of packet and optical networks. In this paper, we first propose
  a concept called virtual transport link (VTL) to support dynamic link aggregation
  in software-defined IP over optical networks. Then, the VTL-based dynamic bandwidth
  adjustment (VTL-DBA) method is proposed for improving the resource utilization and
  for simplifying service provisioning. The feasibility of our proposals is experimentally
  verified on our software-defined IP over optical networks testbed. The performance
  of the VTL-DBA method is also evaluated based on our simulation platform in terms
  of resource usage, resource utilization, and blocking probability. For carrying
  quality guaranteed services, VTL-DBA saves 25% of transport resources on average
  compared with static bandwidth allocation methods, and it shows an increase of 15%
  in the average resource utilization. For carrying both quality guaranteed services
  and quality tolerant services, VTL-DBA reduces the service blocking probability
  to only 10% on average with higher resource utilization than static bandwidth allocation
  methods.
