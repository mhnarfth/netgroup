abstract: In this paper, we describe the design, implementation and deployment details
  of a two-tier real-time environmental monitoring network in Nebraska. Our state-wide
  sensor network infrastructure uses typical Wireless Sensor Network (WSN) structure
  at tier-two to conduct dynamic sensing tasks with high resolution and flexibility.
  The satellite communication technology is used at tier-one to provide reliable and
  low-cost long-haul connectivity between each local WSN and the central base station.
  By the end of 2009, the entire tier-one infrastructure has been designed and deployed
  to provide state-wide wireless connectivity for 54 monitoring sites equipped with
  1-4 water level transducers. A data and network management framework has also been
  developed to enable the remote network retasking and network performance analysis
  from a central base station. The network web portal offers integrated real-time
  and historical groundwater data to worldwide users. The deployed infrastructure
  will serve as the prototype network to expedite the commercial adoption of large-scale
  WSN design for long-term environmental monitoring applications.
