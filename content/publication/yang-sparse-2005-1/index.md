abstract: In this paper we study an alternate network architecture, called translucent
  network, to the fully transparent and fully opaque network architectures. In a translucent
  wavelength-routed optical network, a technique called sparse regeneration is used
  to overcome the severe lightpath blocking due to signal quality degradation and
  wavelength contention in a fully transparent network while using much less regenerators
  than in a fully opaque network. In this paper, we present a node model and a network
  model that perform sparse regeneration. We address the problem of translucent network
  design by proposing several regenerator placement algorithms based on different
  knowledge of future network traffic patterns. We also address the problem of wavelength
  routing under sparse regeneration by incorporating two regenerator allocation strategies
  with heuristic wavelength routing algorithms. We compare the performance of different
  regenerator placement algorithms and wavelength routing schemes through simulation
  experiments. The benefit of sparse regeneration is quantitatively measured under
  different network settings.
