abstract: Threat intelligence and management systems form a vital component of an
  organization's cybersecurity infrastructure. Threat intelligence, when used with
  active monitoring of network traffic, can be critical to ensure reliable data communication
  between endpoints. Threat intelligence systems are well suited for analyzing anomalous
  behaviors in network traffic and can be employed to assist organizations in identifying
  and successfully responding to cyber-attacks. In this paper, we present a machine
  learning approach for clustering malicious uniform resource locators (URLs). We
  focus on a URL dataset gathered from a threat intelligence feeds framework. We implement
  a k-means clustering solution for grouping malicious URLs obtained from open source
  threat intelligence feeds. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our unsupervised
  learning technique to discover the hidden structures in the malicious URL dataset.
  Our URL keyword/text clustering solution provides valuable insights about the malicious
  URLs and aids network operators in policy decisions to mitigate cyber-attacks. The
  clusters obtained using our approach has a silhouette coefficient of 0.383 for a
  dataset containing over 11,000 malicious URLs. Lastly, we develop a probabilistic
  scoring model to calculate the percentage of malicious keywords present in a given
  URL. After analyzing over 72,000 malicious keywords, our model successfully identifies
  over 80% of the URLs in a test dataset as malicious.
